656326e7a3f6fc78b8eba08c,-681745396,A Complete Guide to Hotel Revenue Management,"November 22, 2023","The hospitality sector is seeing a sharp rise in competition as entrepreneurs strive to provide their clients with a distinctive experience. Not only do they want to provide the best services, but they also increase their revenue while doing so.This is where effective hotel revenue management comes into the picture. By employing specific tactics and the right tools, you can exponentially increase your hotel’s revenue.If you are looking for a guide that briefs you about effective revenue management in the hotel industry, this article is for you.We’ll not only be discussing the core principles of hotel revenue management but also how one can effectively manage the revenue for their hotel – irrespective of the size of the business.So what are you waiting for? Let’s get started!Table of ContentsWhat is Hotel Revenue Management?Hotel revenue management is a heterogeneous approach involving a complete understanding of industrial trends, market dynamics, and consumer behavior. It is not just limited to specific activities like setting the price or other provisions.It involves forecasting demand for your hotel by understanding the buying behavior of different traveler segments and optimizing prices and inventory to get them booked.When you employ revenue management in the hotel industry, you’re looking to attract suitable travelers by selling them the right hotel room at the right price.Fundamentals of Revenue ManagementThe basic idea behind hotel revenue management revolves around several fundamentals necessary for continuous yield management in the hotel industry. These concepts serve as the backbone for employing various strategies of revenue management to optimize financial performance.When used correctly, they can help you decide what products or services to sell and which customers.Here are some fundamentals of hotel revenue management you should know about:Competitive AnalysisAnalyzing competition from other hotels is crucial for effective hotel revenue management. Understanding your prime competitors and the provisions they bring to the table will challenge you to stand apart from the competition and do something different.It is essential to know what your competitors are doing and see if you can provide the same or better at a reasonable price (or with added perks).One must also look out for the smaller, mid-budget options since this will keep you a step ahead of both old and new competitors.ForecastingForecasting is critical to forming an understanding of your expectations with your business. It helps you identify the most realistic goals you’d want your business to achieve in a given timeframe.Through forecasting, you can leverage some valuable ideas and set up strategies for revenue management by conducting a thorough analysis of your business.You can start by comparing current numbers with the achievements and failures of the last month (or year), analyze the progress made, and analyze customer sentiment.PricingOnce you’re done forecasting, it’s about identifying a price point that not only attracts customers but also keeps your business afloat.With pricing being a fundamental element of hotel revenue management, you need to:Based on these, you can set a fixed price or go for seasonal rates, whichever works best.Inventory ControlAfter setting up the correct prices, you should monitor the inventory to ensure that the services and products are aligned with the goals you’ve set for your hotel.This not only helps you manage inventory better but you can also upscale or downscale it based on the requirements.Performance ReviewThe final step in the hotel revenue management process involves regular monitoring and performance analysis for your hotel. You can review the results based on the budget, revenue generated, customers gained, or how much business your competitors got in the same timeframe.Moreover, you can also use the insights to compare them with the previous year’s data.The Core Principles of Hotel Revenue ManagementThere are a few core principles of hotel revenue management that one should know about. Here they are:Production DistributionProduction distribution is the foremost principle of hotel revenue management. It deals with the optimization of available rooms for maximizing revenue for your hotel. Production distribution includes strategically distributing rooms across channels like online travel agencies, direct bookings, and GDS or global distribution systems.One must carefully manage this by minimizing distribution costs and selling rooms through the most profitable channels only for more efficient yield management in their hotel.Market SegmentationMarket segmentation involves categorizing your customers into diverse groups based on their preferences, demographics, and behavior. Doing this ensures that you’re tailoring the pricing and promotional strategies to meet the requirements of specific customer groups.By gaining a proper understanding of each segment, you can optimize revenue and attract a diverse and loyal group of customers.Demand ForecastingDemand forecasting involves studying historical data, market trends, and other external factors to help predict future demands for hotel rooms.The revenue managers usually use this data to make crucial decisions about inventory management and pricing and ensure that they meet the demands and needs of the customer while also optimizing the revenue.Supply ForecastingSupply forecasting is a crucial principle in hotel revenue management focused on predicting the availability of room inventory. It involves analyzing factors like room maintenance schedules, renovations, and changes in room types to ensure an accurate assessment of the hotel’s supply.By forecasting supply effectively, hotels can align their pricing and marketing strategies accordingly, preventing overbooking or underutilization.Overbooking controlControlling overbooking is another crucial aspect of revenue management in the hotel industry focused on managing room inventory and maximizing revenue and occupancy.Careful monitoring and controlling of overbookings can minimize losses occurring due to empty rooms and ensure customer satisfaction.Tools and Technologies Used for Hotel Revenue ManagementUsing the right tools and technologies is among the most effective strategies for revenue management. Here are a few you need to know:Business Intelligence SoftwareBusiness intelligence software provides all-round visibility into the inner workings of your hotel.It not only focuses on hotel revenue management but also the number of customers, rooms booked, and month-on-month growth in terms of numbers. It also helps in tracking and to build automated performance reports.Global Distribution SystemsGlobal distribution systems help ensure efficient hotel revenue management by expanding the reach of your hotel to a broader, more international audience using various distribution channels.It ensures seamless room availability, real-time reservations, and dynamic pricing. Doing this allows your hotel to maximize occupancy and gain more revenue per customer.Online Travel AgentsOnline travel agents are the most renowned distribution channels a hotel uses to list their rooms for bookings. Transient guests often use them to book their hotel rooms.By using an online travel agent, your hotel can reach out to more diverse customers, eventually increasing both your customer base and revenue.Channel Management ToolsChannel management tools integrate with online travel agents for room and pricing management.They also offer a centralized dashboard and management engine, allowing you to see the number of bookings accepted or declined, alongside making price-related changes to the listings.Property Management SystemsHotel employees often use property management software to automate check-ins, billing, and reservations. These tools are more focused on on-site operations and help in improving efficiency.They also help you store guest information at a centralized location and provide tailored services to them.The Role of Data in Revenue ManagementData plays a crucial role in the entire hotel revenue management lifecycle. Through in-depth analysis, hotel owners can set optimal room rates and make informed decisions about pricing and inventory allocation in real-time.Furthermore, you can also leverage the entire collection of guest data to not only offer personalized services but also retain them for the long run.Pricing Strategies in Hotel Revenue ManagementThere are multiple pricing strategies used for optimal hotel revenue management. As a business owner, implementing these strategies can be crucial.Let’s find out what they are:Demand-based pricingDeciding room rates per the traveler’s demand is called demand-based pricing, which depends on the insights gathered from previous occupancy, revenue, or expense data.By combining these with the forecast patterns, hotel revenue managers use this method to set the prices accordingly.Rate parity pricingThe rate parity pricing method helps build customer credibility over time. It ensures that the room rate is consistent across all platforms.Room rates appear the same across all distribution channels, including the hotel website or other booking platforms.Occupancy-based pricingThe occupancy-based pricing strategy is quite dynamic since the rates tend to fluctuate as the occupancy level increases.\n\nIn such scenarios, managers either increase or decrease the room rates as occupancy rises or decreases.Market segment pricingThe market rate for rooms may be restricted due to rate parity pricing. However, hotels can generate revenue by negotiating discounts with their corporate clients.These discounts may cause revenue loss to an extent, but the guarantee of room night production negates it.\n\nThe increase in room night production can also boost the hotel’s occupancy.Forecasting and Demand ManagementCustomer segmentation is a crucial step in hotel revenue management and also plays a key role in efficient demand forecasting. As a business owner, it’s critical to identify high and low-yield rooms or inventory. It not only ensures better inventory management but can also help you optimize the pricing to ensure incremental revenue.The demand of different segments during different periods also needs to be taken care of.Knowledge of the upcoming trends and yield management in the hotel industry may also help you with staffing and marketing.You may accept early bookings during the low-demand period, whereas late bookings can help capture the high-yielding guests at the last minute.To ensure this, you need to understand the concept of constrained and unconstrained demands.Constrained demandIn simple terms, constrained demand is the maximum demand for all the rooms your hotel can provide. So, for example, if you’ve got 20 rooms on your property, the demand for them would equal 20.Unconstrained demandIt is the number of rooms that can be booked in a single day if you have no limits on the number of rooms. Suppose your property has 30 rooms, but the demand is for 50 rooms – the unconstrained demand would be 50.Distribution Channels and Inventory ManagementThe process of monitoring the inventory and controlling it is called hotel inventory management. It helps you decide the number of rooms you need to allocate to the different channels and when to restrict your business, among others.Understandably, not all customer segments will give you profitable business throughout the year. So, ensuring effective yield management becomes crucial.You need to balance out the high-yielding business with the low-yielding one. The former may be short-term, whereas the latter can be comparatively longer.If you cut down the business from the low-yield guests, it may hamper the customer relationship. This is where hotel yield management becomes more crucial.Here are some things that you need to consider while managing hotel inventory:Opening and closing the distribution channelsEach distribution channel needs to be managed keeping in mind their business potential. For example, direct bookings don’t require compensation, whereas corporate booking rates are slightly lower.This is where you’ll need to make a choice and ensure you’re using the distribution channels better.The best time to accept the bookingsHaving the analytics of the hotel over time helps you understand traveler behavior for better yield management in hotels. You can decide the booking window for different segments on your distribution channel.It will also give you an idea of the best time to accept the low-yielding bookings.Check OverbookingYou would want to avoid affecting customer satisfaction due to something as crucial as overbooking. It’s essential to keep track of them to avoid the cost of shifting the customer to a different property simply because you are liable for their inconvenience.Revenue Management for Different Hotel TypesHotel revenue management practices can vary drastically with the type and nature of hotels. As a thumb rule, each hotel must have a tailored approach to managing their revenues better. Here’s how you can do this for each of them:Luxury HotelsAs luxury hotels focus more on the lavish lifestyle and personalized services, such hotels emphasize maintaining high average rates while providing the most premium experiences.Increased pricing during the peak period is quite common for luxury hotels, whereas maintaining an average rate helps them be consistent in revenue throughout the year – especially during the low phases.Boutique HotelsThese hotels focus on a particular niche and unique themes to attract customers and stand out. As a result, they try to improve the experience through various add-ons and services that enhance the overall customer experience.Business HotelsBusiness hotels focus more on establishing long-term relationships with corporate clients for different events. The hotels offer negotiated prices and tailor the package according to their client.On other days, they also offer competitive market rates for traveling business people.Budget HotelsThese hotels focus on catering to the price-conscious segment while maintaining profitability. The occupancy can be amplified by value-added services like free Wi-Fi, breakfast, and accessible shuttle services as part of the package without increasing prices significantly. For such hotels, increasing occupancy rates in the off-season is given more importance.Final ThoughtsProviding customers with the best possible experience through various services is the main objective of any hotel business. As a business owner, you want to create a memorable customer experience while increasing their LTV in the long term.This is precisely where hotel revenue management holds the key to your success. Being mindful of it helps your business thrive, beat the competition, and grow profitability year-on-year.If you’re serious about optimizing the growth of your hotel business, you must focus on using the strategies outlined above to create a unique experience for your customers.FAQsWhat is revenue management in a hotel?Revenue management in the hotel industry includes optimizing inventory, distribution strategies, and pricing to increase revenue by balancing demand, rates, and occupancy.What are the pillars of revenue management?The following are the pillars of effective hotel revenue management:What is the formula for hotel revenue?Various formulas can calculate the hotel revenue, which includes total occupancy rate, ADR, RevPAR, GopPAR & NRevPAR, among others.How does revenue management differ from traditional pricing strategies used in hotels?Hotel revenue management helps you to price your rooms according to the peak time or low time in your region through a detailed analysis of the data recorded over some time. In contrast, traditional pricing strategies are based on mere experiences.What are the three main concepts used in revenue management?The three main concepts used in hotel revenue management are customer segmentation, demand forecasting, and price management.",https://rategain.com/blog/guide-to-hotel-revenue-management/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/A-Complete-Guide-to-Hotel-Revenue-Management.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/A-Complete-Guide-to-Hotel-Revenue-Management.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Learn-How-Hotels-can-Maximize-Revenue-Through-Effective-Pricing-Techniques.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,,,Revenue Management,,,,,,,0
656326e9a3f6fc78b8eba08e,879831347,The Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Right Hotel Booking Engine,"November 22, 2023","As technology continues to reshape the way travelers plan and book their accommodations, hotels must stay ahead of the curve to meet the demands of modern guests. At the heart of this digital transformation is the hotel booking engine, a critical tool that can significantly impact a guest’s booking experience and a hotel’s bottom line. And so, we bring to you this guide to choosing the right hotel booking engine.This ultimate guide aims to assist hoteliers in navigating the myriad options available when selecting a booking engine; delving into the essential features and considerations that can make a significant difference in enhancing the overall booking experience for both hoteliers and their guests.Whether you’re a boutique inn or a sprawling resort, this guide will provide valuable insights to help you make an informed decision and optimize your online presence in the competitive world of hospitality.Table of ContentsUnderstanding Hotel Booking EnginesHotel search engines are online systems that allow guests to check room availability, view details, compare rates, and complete reservations directly on a hotel’s website. The engine is integrated with the property management system (PMS) and central reservation system (CRS) to provide real-time inventory and pricing.How do Hotel Booking Engines work?When a guest confirms a booking through the engine, the reservation data is instantly synchronized with the PMS and CRS. This automation eliminates manual data entry and gives staff an up-to-date view of all booked available, and occupied rooms. The hotel search engines effectively act as a bridge between the hotel’s core operational systems and the customer-facing web platform.The hotel room search engine displays dynamic rates, amenities, room types, packages, and other details through a search interface. Customers enter their travel dates and preferences to view applicable room options and current prices. The intuitive booking process allows guests to select their room type easily, input details, view total pricing, enter payment, and complete reservations entirely online.Advantages of implementing hotel search enginesKey advantages of implementing a hotel search engine include the following:With the right hotel engine, properties benefit from higher revenues, operational efficiency, and delivery of superior guest experiences.Key Features to Consider in a Hotel Booking EngineWhen researching and evaluating potential hotel engine search solutions, there are several key features to look for:The Different Types of Booking EnginesThe hotel search engine landscape offers diverse solutions. Here is an overview of the main types available:Independent booking enginesThese are standalone booking systems designed specifically for hotels. They are deeply customizable engines that integrate directly with the hotel’s website or as a white label embed.Independent engines offer the most features, flexibility, and optimization capabilities to maximize bookings, revenue, and guest experience. However, the setup and maintenance are handled by the hotel.Chain / brand booking enginesMany large hotel chains and brands offer their own booking systems for member properties. These engines have pre-determined design templates and features aimed at reinforcing brand consistency.While the core functionality meets needs, the machines have limited hotel ability to customize or tailor to their specific market deeply. The chain IT team typically handles setup, management, and support.Channel manager enginesSome channel managers provide a basic hotel search engine or widget for their broader distribution package. These are lightweight and focused primarily on the connectivity with various OTAs.Customization and functionality are constrained compared to standalone solutions. On the plus side, setup and maintenance are handled by the channel manager.PMS built-in enginesMany hotel PMS platforms offer a web booking module or portal that provides core booking engine capabilities. Hotel room search engines are convenient since they are natively integrated and pre-configured to work with the PMS. However, they are typically limited in branding, customization, and merchandising features.Third-party enginesThese are hosted booking systems provided by third-party intermediaries like online travel agencies. Integration allows a hotel’s inventory to be searchable and bookable on the OTA site. However, the design and functionality are fully controlled by the OTA. Direct bookings are minimal since most reservations occur on the aggregator site versus the hotel website.Evaluating these key differences and weighing them against a property’s requirements helps determine the ideal hotel booking engine approach.Factors to Consider When Choosing a Booking EngineSelecting the right booking engine is an important decision that impacts guest experience, operations, and revenue. Here are some of the key factors for hotels to carefully evaluate when choosing a solution:Prioritizing these parameters based on your hotel’s unique requirements helps determine the ideal booking engine match.Evaluating and Comparing Booking Engine ProvidersHere is a methodology for thoroughly evaluating and comparing potential booking engine providers:Running an exhaustive evaluation process maximizes your chances of choosing the optimal booking engine for your needs.Implementation and OnboardingOnce a booking engine provider has been selected, bringing the new system online requires careful planning and execution.

Key trends shaping the future of hotel room search engines include:Final ThoughtsImplementing a modern, customizable hotel engine search is crucial for properties to effectively compete, boost direct bookings, lift online conversions, maximize revenues, reduce costs, and provide a superior guest experience. However, identifying the ideal booking engine hinges on thoroughly evaluating key factors like technical integration, required functionality, ease of use, design customization, security provisions, performance metrics, and provider reputation.Comparing multiple solutions suited for your hotel profile and requirements is highly recommended before deciding. Booking engine setup is also a meticulous process requiring careful planning and execution across design configuration, integration testing, data migration, staff training, and launch. Keeping future technology trends in mind also ensures your engine can evolve in capabilities over time. With a robust booking engine optimized for your needs, hotels gain a valuable platform for driving more bookings, enhancing guest interactions, and growing revenue channels.FAQsWhat is the best booking engine for hotels?There is no universally “best” hotel booking engine. The optimal solution depends on factors like size, budget, brand standards, required capabilities, integration needs, and internal resources of the hotel. Comparing solutions that align with your specifics delivers the ideal fit.How can I improve my hotel booking system?Improving your hotel search engine involves:How do I choose a booking system?To choose a system, create requirements based on features needed, evaluate leading vendor options, get demos, assess integrations with your existing tech stack, review customization flexibility, ensure security provisions, compare ongoing support services, and verify performance capacities suit your demand volumes.How do we maintain an efficient booking system?Maintain booking engine efficiency through continual performance monitoring, frequent testing across devices, implementing technology updates, addressing bugs/issues quickly, integrating with other platforms, training staff on new features, optimizing user flows, and leveraging guest data and analytics to maximize revenue.How do I ensure a smooth integration of the booking engine with my hotel’s website?Work closely across teams during the discovery, planning, design, development, and testing phases.

These factors contribute to the decline of many species. Wildlife trafficking, driven by the demand for exotic souvenirs and pets, poses another threat. Travelers, unknowingly or not, sometimes contribute to these problems.Wildlife Protection and Biodiversity Conservation in TravelThe Travel Industry’s Responsibility in Biodiversity ConservationThe travel industry has a critical role in preserving biodiversity and protecting wildlife. It’s not just about ticking off the “eco-friendly” box in marketing materials. It’s a matter of ethical responsibility and ensuring that future generations can enjoy the wonders of our planet.Conservation Through EducationOne way the travel industry contributes is through educating travelers. When tourists understand the significance of the wildlife and ecosystems they encounter, they’re more likely to act responsibly. Eco-tour guides, informative brochures, and nature documentaries can all play a part in this.Sustainable Tourism PracticesSustainability is more than a buzzword. Sustainable tourism means minimizing your environmental and social impact while maximizing the positive benefits for local communities and conservation efforts. Travel companies are increasingly adopting sustainable practices, from eco-lodges powered by renewable energy to wildlife safaris that fund conservation projects.Community Engagement and EmpowermentIn many travel destinations, local communities are the stewards of their natural surroundings. Engaging with and empowering these communities economically can be a win-win. It helps protect biodiversity while also improving the livelihoods of the people who live alongside it.Wildlife ProtectionTravelers often seek encounters with wildlife. But these interactions must be responsible and respectful. For example, observing animals in their natural habitat, with minimal intrusion, is far preferable to supporting attractions that exploit animals for entertainment.Supporting Conservation EffortsMany travel companies partner with conservation organizations. These collaborations might involve funding research, protecting habitat, or even reintroducing endangered species. By choosing to travel with such companies, you can directly contribute to conservation efforts.Your Role as a TravelerAs a traveler, you also have a crucial role to play. Research your destinations and choose operators committed to sustainability. Respect local regulations and guidelines, such as staying on marked trails in protected areas. Avoid purchasing products made from endangered wildlife or plants.Wildlife protection and biodiversity conservation in travel are not just buzzwords but ethical imperatives.

Now, all it took was a few clicks on your device, and voilà – your reservation was made.The Transformation of the Trusty Old KeyAnd what about those trusty old physical keys? They underwent a remarkable transformation. No longer did you need to carry around a clunky piece of metal that could easily be misplaced or lost. Instead, your key became a digital code residing right on your smartphone screen. With a simple tap or scan, you could unlock your room or gain access to your table at the restaurant. It was not just convenient; it was the embodiment of the digital revolution happening all around us.This shift marked a pivotal moment in the hospitality industry’s history. It wasn’t just about replacing physical keys with digital codes; it was about ushering in an era of unparalleled convenience, efficiency, and connectivity. The days of analog hospitality were waning, making way for a new digital frontier that promised exciting possibilities for both guests and businesses alike.The Rise of Online Reviews: Shaping Hospitality’s DestinyThen came the era of online reviews. This transformational era was spearheaded by platforms such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, forever altering the landscape of guest experiences and the way hotels and restaurants manage their reputations.Picture this: you’ve just had an exquisite meal at a charming little restaurant tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. In the past, your enjoyment might have remained a cherished memory shared with friends and family. But in the age of digital reviews, your experience takes on a whole new dimension.What Changed for the Guests?With a few effortless taps on your smartphone or keyboard, you can now broadcast your culinary adventure to the world. This newfound ability to share your thoughts, feelings, and impressions with fellow travelers and food enthusiasts alike is nothing short of revolutionary. It’s like having a megaphone to express your joy, satisfaction, or even disappointment.What Changed for the Hotels & Restaurants?Digital Reviews became critical for Brand ReputationThe feedback from guests, once confined to in-house comment cards, now flowed freely on the internet. It was a double-edged sword: a single glowing review could draw hordes of eager guests, while a negative one could send potential patrons running for the hills.Reviews became a Driving Force in the IndustryThe significance of online reviews stretched far beyond mere feedback; they became a driving force in the hospitality industry.Personalization: Your Name in LightsIn the ever-evolving landscape of the UK’s hospitality industry, one word became the guiding star – “personalization.” It’s the kind of magic that makes you feel like a VIP, even in a bustling hotel or a busy restaurant. As technology continued to get smarter, hospitality businesses embraced the art of making guests feel not just welcomed, but truly cherished.Picture this: You walk into a hotel, and before you even utter a word, the staff greets you by name. It’s as if they’ve been expecting you, and that’s because they have – thanks to the digital wizardry at play. Your preferences, your history with the establishment, even your dietary restrictions, all neatly tucked away in their digital archives.Hotels, in particular, became masters of this personalized experience.Your room might have your favorite type of pillow, the temperature set just right to your liking, and your preferred morning newspaper waiting outside your door. It’s like they’ve taken all your habits and preferences and created a tailor-made oasis just for you.Restaurants didn’t lag behind either.Imagine strolling into your favorite eatery, and even before you glance at the menu, the waiter suggests your go-to dish. It’s like they’ve peeked into your culinary dreams. But it’s not magic; it’s the result of data-driven insights and technology working in harmony.How it WorksAll of this, the personalized greetings, the spot-on service, and the anticipatory gestures, they’re not the work of a mysterious butler; they’re the result of the meticulous data analysis, a dash of artificial intelligence, and the genuine desire to make every guest feel special.Contactless Everything: Embracing the Future of HospitalityFast forward to the present, and you’ll find the UK’s hospitality industry firmly entrenched in the contactless era. It’s a time where convenience and safety are the guiding stars, particularly in the aftermath of a global pandemic that forever altered the way we interact with the world.Mobile Check-InsPicture this: You arrive at your hotel, tired after a long journey. Instead of waiting in a line at the front desk, you whip out your smartphone. With a few taps, you complete your check-in process. Your room details and a virtual key are sent directly to your device. No physical contact, no paperwork, just seamless efficiency. Mobile check-ins have become the new standard, liberating guests from the traditional check-in hassles.Keyless EntriesOnce inside the hotel, you’re greeted by yet another innovation – keyless entry systems. Your smartphone, now equipped with a digital key, effortlessly unlocks your room door. No more fumbling with key cards or worrying about losing them. It’s a touchless experience that marries security and convenience in a way that was once unimaginable.Contactless PaymentsAt the hotel’s restaurant, you indulge in a sumptuous meal, and when the check arrives, there’s no need to exchange physical cash or cards. Contactless payments are the order of the day. A simple tap of your smartphone or credit card is all it takes to settle the bill. It’s not just faster; it’s also safer, reducing the need for physical exchange of currency or card swiping.Safety in a Post-Pandemic WorldThe seismic shift towards contactless interactions is, in large part, a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a world where physical touch suddenly posed risks, the hospitality industry swiftly adapted to prioritize the health and safety of guests and staff alike. Contactless solutions minimize physical contact points, reducing the potential spread of germs.Beyond the PandemicWhile the pandemic accelerated the adoption of contactless technology, it’s clear that these changes are here to stay. They’ve not only proven to be safer but also more efficient, enhancing the overall guest experience. As we move forward, contactless innovations will continue to evolve, shaping the future of hospitality and offering guests a level of convenience and peace of mind that was once unimaginable.Data, Data, Data: The Golden Era of Guest InsightsGuest data underwent a transformation from being trapped in dusty registers to becoming a goldmine.From Dusty Registers to Digital GoldIn the good old days, hotel check-ins involved scribbling down your details in a paper register. Dining at a restaurant meant your preferences were largely a mystery to the establishment. But then came the digital awakening.Guest data, once locked in those dusty registers, was suddenly set free. It found a new home in secure digital vaults, ready to be mined for valuable insights. Names, preferences, stay histories, dining choices – it was all there, waiting to be explored.Unearthing Deep Customer InsightsHotels and restaurants didn’t waste any time. They tapped into advanced data analytics like never before. With these powerful tools, they could unravel the stories hidden within the data. They learned about guests’ favorite room types, their preferred dining times, and even the kind of pillows they liked. It was like having an x-ray vision into their guests’ desires and expectations.Tailor-Made ExperiencesThis newfound knowledge wasn’t stashed away; it was put to good use. Personalization became the name of the game. When you walked into a hotel, you weren’t just another guest; you were a familiar face. The front desk knew your name and welcomed you back like an old friend. Restaurants greeted you with your favorite dish, making every visit feel like a homecoming.Supercharged Marketing EffortsBut the power of data didn’t stop there. Hotels and restaurants used it to transform their marketing strategies. No more generic ads that missed the mark. They knew exactly who to target and when. Special offers, tailored recommendations, and targeted promotions flooded inboxes, enticing guests in a way that felt almost magical.Efficiency Like Never BeforeHere’s the icing on the cake – data-driven marketing wasn’t just effective; it was efficient. Marketing budgets could be allocated with pinpoint accuracy. Wasteful spending became a thing of the past. Every pound invested in marketing had a clear purpose and a high chance of generating returns.Challenges Along the Way: Weathering the StormsBut wait, this voyage wasn’t all smooth sailing under clear skies. The hospitality industry encountered its fair share of tempests on its digital journey. These challenges weren’t mere raindrops; they were full-blown storms that tested the mettle of hotels and restaurants.Data Fortification in the Face of Cyber ThreatsImagine a fortress protecting invaluable treasures. In the digital age, guest data became the most precious of treasures. Hotels and restaurants had to stand guard against a constant barrage of cyber threats. The battle for data security was a formidable challenge. Breaches could result in not just financial losses but also the trust of their guests. Strengthening digital fortifications became a top priority.The Battle of Online CompetitionPicture a bustling marketplace, with vendors vying for the attention of shoppers. The digital realm transformed into a competitive arena for hotels and restaurants. Standing out amidst the digital crowd, especially for smaller establishments with limited resources, was akin to a battle. Navigating this battlefield while upholding quality standards posed a significant challenge.Dance with Shifting AlgorithmsThink of search engines and social media platforms as ever-evolving dance partners. These platforms constantly tweaked their algorithms, changing the dance steps. Adapting to these moves and staying visible and relevant became an intricate dance for marketers. One had to keep up with the rhythm or risk being left behind in the digital waltz.Guest Expectations Riding HighImagine guests as discerning critics, always seeking perfection. In a digitalized world, guest expectations soared. They expected seamless, personalized experiences at their fingertips. Meeting and exceeding these elevated standards presented its own set of challenges. Hotels and restaurants had to ensure that their digital services matched these lofty aspirations.Compliance TightropeThink of compliance as a tightrope walker’s balancing act. With digitalization came a slew of regulations related to data privacy and security. Navigating the intricacies of these compliance requirements was akin to walking the fine line on a tightrope. One wrong step could have legal consequences and damage a brand’s reputation.What’s Next: Embracing the Future of UK HospitalityAs we stand at the crossroads of the UK’s hospitality industry’s evolution, one thing is abundantly clear: the journey is far from over. In fact, it’s only getting started, and the road ahead is filled with exciting possibilities and innovations.Continuous Technological EvolutionThe heartbeat of this industry is technology, and it will continue to evolve at a breakneck pace. Expect more cutting-edge solutions that will redefine how guests interact with hotels and restaurants. We’re talking about advancements in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and Internet of Things (IoT) that will take personalization and convenience to new heights.Sustainability and Eco-ConsciousnessAnother path the industry is likely to tread is the one of sustainability. With a growing global focus on environmental responsibility, we can anticipate hotels and restaurants embracing eco-friendly practices. From energy-efficient buildings to farm-to-table dining experiences, the UK’s hospitality sector will likely play a significant role in promoting a greener future.Enhanced Health and Safety MeasuresGiven the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, health and safety will remain paramount. Expect hotels and restaurants to continually refine and expand their contactless services, sanitation protocols, and guest safety measures. These innovations will provide peace of mind and further elevate the guest experience.Immersive Digital ExperiencesImmersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and extended reality (XR) may find their way into the industry. Guests could soon embark on virtual tours of their chosen accommodations, explore restaurant interiors, or even preview their meals before placing an order. These immersive experiences will bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds.A Revamped Culinary LandscapeIn the culinary realm, we can look forward to more diverse and unique dining experiences. Fusion cuisines, inventive dishes, and collaborations between chefs and local artisans will continue to delight our taste buds. The farm-to-table movement will thrive, fostering stronger connections between diners and the source of their food.The Human Touch Remains EssentialWhile technology will play a significant role, the human touch will remain irreplaceable. Exceptional service, warm hospitality, and genuine interactions will continue to define the industry. Technology will enhance, not replace, the guest experience.The evolution of UK hospitality scene has been a journey filled with ups and downs, but one that keeps on getting better.

6563270ea3f6fc78b8eba0be,-1643007307,Driving Green: The Future of Sustainable Car Rentals,"September 1, 2023","In a world increasingly concerned with environmental sustainability, the way we travel is undergoing a transformation. Transportation is a major contributor to carbon emissions, and one industry that’s making substantial strides toward a greener future is car rentals.Let us know explore the exciting trends shaping the future of sustainable car rental services, making your next road trip not only memorable but eco-conscious as well.Table of ContentsEco-Friendly Travel: Trends in Sustainable Car RentalsElectric Vehicle (EV) RevolutionOne of the most significant trends in sustainable car rentals is the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). Rental companies are increasingly adding EVs to their fleets, allowing customers to enjoy the benefits of these eco-friendly vehicles. As charging infrastructure continues to expand, it becomes more convenient for travelers to rent EVs and embark on emissions-free journeys. The transition to EVs not only reduces carbon emissions but also lowers fuel costs for customers.Eco-Friendly FleetsCar rental companies are also revamping their fleets by transitioning to fuel-efficient and low-emission vehicles. This move is not only environmentally responsible but also financially savvy, as it reduces fuel expenses and minimizes the ecological footprint. Many rental companies are also incorporating sustainable materials and manufacturing practices into their vehicles, further enhancing their eco-credentials.Carsharing and Peer-to-Peer RentalsThe sharing economy has had a significant impact on the car rental industry. Carsharing and peer-to-peer rental platforms allow individuals to rent their vehicles to others, promoting efficient use of existing resources. This trend encourages local and community engagement while reducing the need for additional vehicle production. It’s a win-win for both renters and the environment.Technology Advancements in Sustainable Car RentalsTechnology is playing a pivotal role in the sustainability of car rentals. Smart car rental platforms allow customers to locate and unlock vehicles through mobile apps, reducing the need for physical paperwork and streamlining the rental process. These platforms also enable car rental companies to monitor and maintain their fleets efficiently.Enhanced Mobility SolutionsCar rental services are no longer limited to standalone offerings. They are increasingly integrating with public transit systems, offering multi-modal transportation solutions. This means you can seamlessly combine car rentals with other modes of travel like trains, buses, and bikes, creating more sustainable and convenient travel options.Sustainable Business PracticesCar rental companies are taking steps to offset their carbon emissions. Many offer customers the option to purchase carbon offsets to neutralize the environmental impact of their journeys. Additionally, rental companies are obtaining green certifications and committing to responsible environmental practices, ensuring that sustainability is at the core of their operations.Customer Demand and Awareness about Sustainable Car RentalsPerhaps the most significant driver of sustainability in car rentals is the growing demand from eco-conscious travelers. More people are recognizing the importance of making sustainable choices, including their mode of transportation. Car rental companies are responding by educating customers about their green initiatives, offering transparency about the eco-credentials of their vehicles, and providing incentives for making environmentally responsible choices.As the world moves toward a more sustainable future, the car rental industry is playing a vital role in reducing the carbon footprint of travelers. Whether you’re a seasoned road warrior or planning your first adventure, you’ll find valuable insights into the future of sustainable transportation in the car rental industry. The trends mentioned above are not only reshaping the way we travel but also helping us make greener choices on the road.So, the next time you embark on a journey, consider opting for a sustainable car rental to drive green and contribute to a more eco-friendly world.",https://rategain.com/blog/future-of-sustainable-car-rentals/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Driving-Green-The-Future-of-Sustainable-Car-Rentals.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Driving-Green-The-Future-of-Sustainable-Car-Rentals.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Blog,,,sustainability,,,,,,,0
65632711a3f6fc78b8eba0c0,-1131433279,Taste the Future: Sustainable Food Practices in Hotels and Restaurants,"September 1, 2023","In a world that’s increasingly conscious of its environmental footprint, the food industry has a significant role to play. This blog dives into the delicious realm of sustainable food practices in hotels and restaurants, exploring the Farm-to-Table movement and other innovative approaches. Join us as we savor the flavors of eco-conscious dining and discover how it’s changing the way we eat out.Table of ContentsThe Farm-to-Table RevolutionLocal Sourcing: Local Sourcing: Nurturing Communities and FlavorOne of the fundamental principles of sustainable dining is local sourcing. Restaurants and hotels are increasingly forging partnerships with nearby farmers and artisans. By doing so, they not only secure a fresh and diverse supply of ingredients but also contribute to the economic vitality of their communities.Local sourcing offers a range of benefits:By embracing local sourcing, restaurants and hotels not only reduce their environmental impact but also offer a more authentic and community-driven dining experience.Reduced Food Miles: Minimizing Environmental ImpactReducing food miles is a core concept in sustainable food practices. Food miles refer to the distance that food travels from its place of production to the consumer’s plate. The shorter the distance, the fewer carbon emissions are generated during transportation.Restaurants and hotels embracing sustainability aim to source ingredients locally or regionally whenever possible. This approach has several positive environmental impacts:Supporting Communities: A Win-Win ApproachOne of the lesser-known perks of local sourcing in sustainable dining is its impact on communities. When restaurants and hotels choose to buy from local farmers, they create a symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties.Sustainable dining isn’t just about the food on the plate; it’s also about the positive impact on the people who produce it. By fostering these community ties, restaurants and hotels contribute to the overall well-being of the regions they serve.\nOther Sustainable Food Practices in Hotels and Restaurants: Beyond Farm-to-TableZero Food Waste: Innovative Approaches to Reducing WasteIn the realm of sustainable dining, tackling food waste is a paramount concern. The food industry is notorious for generating substantial amounts of waste, from kitchen scraps to unfinished meals left on diners’ plates. To address this issue, restaurants and hotels are adopting innovative approaches to minimize waste.Zero food waste isn’t just about being environmentally responsible; it also makes financial sense for businesses. By minimizing waste, restaurants and hotels can reduce costs and enhance their sustainability credentials.Plant-Based Menus: Embracing Sustainability and HealthA significant trend in sustainable dining is the rise of plant-based menus. Restaurants and hotels are increasingly offering diverse and delectable plant-based options to cater to diners who seek more sustainable and health-conscious choices.Plant-based menus not only reduce the environmental impact associated with meat production but also align with the growing interest in healthier eating. These menus are not limited to salads; chefs are crafting innovative and flavorful plant-based dishes that satisfy both vegetarians and omnivores.By incorporating more fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains into their menus, establishments can significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Plant-based diets generally require fewer natural resources, such as water and land, compared to traditional meat-heavy diets.Furthermore, embracing plant-based dining can attract a broader customer base, including those with dietary restrictions and ethical preferences. It’s a win-win for sustainability and customer satisfaction.Sustainable Seafood: Protecting Oceans and Marine LifeThe sustainability of seafood sourcing is a critical aspect of eco-conscious dining. Restaurants, particularly those specializing in seafood, are taking steps to ensure that the fish and shellfish they serve are sourced responsibly and sustainably.Sustainable seafood sourcing contributes to the protection of marine ecosystems and the preservation of vulnerable species. It also helps ensure a future where seafood remains a viable and healthy dining option.How Diners Can ParticipateHow Restaurants Can Lead the WayThe Farm-to-Table movement and sustainable food practices aren’t just about culinary trends; they’re a step towards a more eco-conscious dining experience.Whether you’re a diner or a restaurant owner, embracing sustainable food practices not only tantalizes your taste buds but also contributes to a healthier planet.",https://rategain.com/blog/sustainable-food-practices-in-hotels-and-restaurants/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Taste-the-Future-Sustainable-Food-Practices-in-Hospitality.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Taste-the-Future-Sustainable-Food-Practices-in-Hospitality.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Blog,,,sustainability,,,,,,,0

As the city prepares to host the prestigious G20 Summit 2023, insights from RateGain data showcase a demand index soaring over 87, a remarkable 40% higher than usual. The past 75 days have witnessed an extraordinary travel demand trend for the National Capital Region (NCR), setting the stage for an unparalleled experience.The Hotel ADRs are SkyrocketingThe surge is palpable in hotel rates, reaching new heights between September 7th and 11th. With an average increase of over 200% in hotel rates (ranging from INR 18,000 to INR 25,000), Delhi’s accommodations mirror the intensified interest in travel during this momentous event. The meteoric rise of the Average Daily Rate (ADR) to INR 26,000 during the G-20 period, as compared to the year-long average of INR 6,000, further underscores the city’s magnetism during this time.Occupancies are at 100%Delhi’s hotels are at full throttle, operating at an impressive 100% occupancy rate between September 7th and 11th. The prominence of solo travelers indicates a strong business-centric trend, reflecting the city’s global significance.

Strategic marketing, eased travel restrictions, and India’s diverse cultural experiences are all driving factors behind this surge.Top Origin CountriesSource: Adara, a RateGain CompanyThe top origin countries exemplify India’s global allure. Australia leads with 24%, closely followed by the USA at 21%, Singapore at 17%, Canada at 9%, and the U.K. at 6%.

65632716a3f6fc78b8eba0c8,1475149705,Connect the Dots: Decoding Common Hotel System Connectivity Challenges,"August 18, 2023","Connecting the dots in a hotel’s technology landscape isn’t always as straightforward as it sounds. While the digital age has transformed guest experiences, it’s also introduced a new set of challenges. In the intricate web of technology that powers the modern hospitality industry, the challenge lies in maintaining seamless connectivity between various hotel systems. Despite the incredible potential that integrated systems offer, a range of issues can emerge, often causing disruptions and inefficiencies.Let’s explore some common challenges that hotels often encounter when managing connectivity between different systems.Table of ContentsExploring Hotel System Connectivity Challenges in Different SystemsLost in Translation: Integration WoesIn the vast landscape of hotel technology, different systems often operate using distinct protocols and languages. Integrating these systems requires bridging the gap between them. However, the process is not always seamless, leading to what can be termed as “integration woes”.When data moves from one system to another, especially between systems developed by different vendors, the potential for misinterpretation or loss of information arises. This can lead to inaccurate or incomplete data being transferred, which in turn affects the accuracy of business decisions. For instance, if the room availability data from a property management system (PMS) doesn’t align perfectly with the data in a distribution channel manager, it could result in overbooked rooms or missed revenue opportunities.Moreover, integrating systems often involves coding interfaces or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable communication between them. These interfaces need to be meticulously designed and regularly updated to ensure the flow of data remains uninterrupted. If these interfaces are poorly designed or not kept up to date, it can lead to data disruptions, causing discrepancies and system failures.Timing Troubles: Synchronization IssuesIn the dynamic world of hospitality, where rooms can be booked and canceled in a matter of seconds, timing is of utmost importance. However, when different systems aren’t perfectly synchronized, timing troubles can arise. For instance, if the inventory data in the property management system doesn’t update in real-time across all distribution channels, it can lead to overbooked rooms.This synchronization issue not only affects the guest experience but also impacts revenue management strategies. Imagine a scenario where a room is booked on an OTA but that information takes a significant amount of time to reflect in the hotel’s internal systems. This lag in synchronization might cause the hotel to turn away potential direct bookings or mismanage its inventory, eventually leading to a revenue loss.Data Deluge: Overwhelming InfluxHotels generate an enormous amount of data daily – from bookings to guest preferences, housekeeping schedules, and more. When this data isn’t managed efficiently, it can lead to a data deluge. A bottleneck in data processing can slow down system performance, resulting in delays and even system crashes.Consider a scenario where a front desk system is processing check-ins while simultaneously sending data to the housekeeping department for room turnover. If the system can’t handle the load, it might freeze or take longer to process, impacting guest experiences and overall operational efficiency.Security Snags: VulnerabilitiesWhile integrating systems for seamless operations is essential, each integration point can potentially become a vulnerability. This is especially crucial in an age where data breaches and cyberattacks are on the rise. When different systems communicate, data flows through these integration points, and any vulnerability in the process can lead to a security breach.For instance, if the connection between a guest’s mobile app and the hotel’s PMS isn’t adequately secured, it could expose sensitive guest information, leading to potential data breaches. Hotels need to ensure that each integration is secure, with proper encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms in place to safeguard guest data and the hotel’s reputation.Compatibility Clash: Differing Systems and UpdatesIn the vast ecosystem of hotel technology, different systems are developed by various vendors, each with its own updates and versions. When these systems need to interact seamlessly, the challenge of compatibility arises.As technology evolves, updates are released to improve functionality, security, and user experience. However, when different systems are not updated in sync, compatibility issues can occur. For instance, if a revenue management system receives an update that changes the way it calculates prices, but the booking engine doesn’t receive the corresponding update, it could result in discrepancies in pricing and availability.Vendor Dependence: Single Point of FailureMany hotels rely on third-party vendors for various technology solutions. While these vendors can offer specialized tools that enhance hotel operations, they can also introduce a single point of failure. If a vendor’s system experiences downtime or malfunctions, it can disrupt the entire chain of operations.Consider a scenario where a distribution channel manager experiences technical difficulties. This could prevent the hotel from updating rates and availability across all its channels, resulting in missed bookings and revenue loss.Language Barrier: Lack of Data Standardization & CoordinationDifferent systems often use different data formats and structures to store information. This can create a language barrier between systems, making it challenging for them to understand and process data seamlessly.For example, a customer’s name might be stored differently in a property management system compared to a CRM system. If these systems can’t communicate in a standardized way, it could lead to incorrect guest information and miscommunication.Miscommunication: Lack of CoordinationEffective communication is key to overcoming connectivity challenges between different hotel systems. Often, issues arise due to miscommunication or lack of coordination among various systems.For example, if the property management system updates room availability but fails to communicate this change to the distribution channels, it can lead to overbookings and guest dissatisfaction.Maintenance Mayhem: Updates and UpgradesRegular updates are necessary to keep systems secure, functional, and aligned with the latest industry trends. However, when these updates are not carried out meticulously, they can lead to system disruptions or even complete breakdowns. The challenge lies in managing updates without affecting ongoing operations.Budget Blues: Cost OverrunsWhile integrating systems offers long-term benefits, the initial setup cost and ongoing expenses can strain a hotel’s budget. Budgeting for integration requires foresight to ensure that the investment translates into improved guest experiences and operational efficiencies that justify the expenditure.Overcoming Hotel System Connectivity ChallengesStreamline Processes with AutomationAmid these challenges, automation emerges as a powerful solution. Automation can streamline data flow between systems, reduce manual intervention, and minimize the chances of errors. By implementing automated processes, hotels can ensure that data is accurately transferred from one system to another, enhancing efficiency and reducing the risk of issues arising from manual data entry.Automation can also help hotels keep up with changing market conditions. For instance, if a competitor adjusts its rates, an automated rate intelligence system can quickly analyze the data and recommend pricing adjustments to stay competitive.Invest in Comprehensive TrainingThe complexity of managing different hotel systems necessitates thorough training for staff members. Inadequate training can lead to errors during data entry, misinterpretation of information, and ineffective utilization of technology solutions.Hotels should provide comprehensive training programs for their employees, ensuring they understand the intricacies of the systems they use. Regular refresher courses and ongoing support can help staff members navigate challenges and maximize the potential of the technology at their disposal.Look for Robust Data Manaement & Analytics SolutionsTo overcome data deluge, hotels often invest in robust data management solutions and data analytics tools. These tools not only help in processing the data efficiently but also provide insights that can guide decision-making.Implement MiddlewareTo tackle synchronization issues, hotels often implement middleware or central platforms that act as intermediaries between different systems, ensuring that data updates are instantaneous and consistent across the board.Look for Partners with Secure IntegrationsTo mitigate security snags, hotels often collaborate with technology partners who specialize in secure integrations. These partners ensure that the integration points are fortified against potential threats, keeping both guest data and the hotel’s operational integrity intact.Embrace Integration SolutionsGiven the array of challenges involved in managing connectivity between different hotel systems, hotels are increasingly turning to integration solutions that provide a holistic approach. These solutions offer pre-built connectors and APIs that facilitate seamless data exchange between systems, reducing the complexities associated with custom integrations.Integration solutions can simplify the management of rates, availability, reservations, and guest data across multiple systems. They enable hotels to remain agile, adapt to market changes, and provide a consistent experience to guests across all touchpoints.Invest in Open Architecture & Updating SystemsTo tackle compatibility challenges, hotels need to ensure that all their systems are updated regularly and that the updates are coordinated across different systems. Additionally, investing in systems that are built on open architecture principles can help ensure easier integration and compatibility.Consider Redundacy SolutionsTo mitigate the risk of vendor dependence, hotels can consider redundancy solutions. This involves having backup systems or alternative vendors that can be activated when the primary system faces issues.Implementing Data Standaradization PracticesTo address the language barrier, hotels can implement data standardization practices. This involves establishing common data formats and structures that all systems agree upon, ensuring that data can be easily exchanged and understood.Bridging the Gap: Effective CommunicationHotels can implement central communication hubs that act as intermediaries between different systems. These hubs ensure that data changes are accurately communicated to all relevant systems in real-time, preventing discrepancies and errors.While managing connectivity between different hotel systems can be complex, the challenges can be mitigated with careful planning, robust technology solutions, and strategic partnerships.Hotels that prioritize seamless integration, data accuracy, and security will be better positioned to navigate the evolving landscape of hospitality technology and remain competitive in a dynamic market.",https://rategain.com/blog/hotel-system-connectivity-challenges/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/The-Hidden-Costs-of-Poor-Hotel-System-Connectivity.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/The-Hidden-Costs-of-Poor-Hotel-System-Connectivity.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,hotel technology,,,,,,,0

They connect hotels to a global audience, allowing travelers to book rooms directly from the hotel’s website. Understanding how these engines work can help you navigate the online booking process more effectively.What is a Hotel Booking Engine?A hotel booking engine is a software application that allows the online booking of accommodations. It’s integrated into a hotel’s website and social media pages, enabling direct bookings. The engine displays the hotel’s live rates and availability, allowing guests to choose their room type, check-in and check-out dates, and make a reservation. The booking engine then processes payments and sends confirmation emails, providing a seamless booking experience for guests.How do Hotel Booking Engines Work?Hotel booking engines work by connecting a hotel’s property management system (PMS) to their website. The PMS updates room availability and rates in real-time, ensuring that guests see accurate information when they’re booking. When a guest makes a reservation, the booking engine captures the guest’s information, processes the payment, and updates the PMS to reflect the new booking. This automation reduces manual work for hotel staff and minimizes the risk of overbooking.What is the relation between Hotel Booking Engines and Hotel Search Engines?A hotel search engine and a hotel booking engine are two distinct but interconnected components of the online hotel reservation process.In essence, a hotel search engine helps users find potential hotels, and a hotel booking engine facilitates the actual booking process. While a hotel search engine provides a broad view of available options, a hotel booking engine is specific to a particular hotel or hotel chain, allowing for direct bookings. Both are crucial parts of the online hotel reservation ecosystem.Regardless, there exists a debate between third-party sites and direct bookings, exploring the pros and cons of each method.Third-Party Sites vs. Direct BookingWhen it comes to booking a hotel room, travelers are often faced with the choice between using third-party sites or booking directly with the hotel. Each method has its advantages and drawbacks, and the best choice depends on your specific needs and circumstances. Let’s delve into the details.Pros and Cons of Third-Party Hotel BookingThird-party hotel booking sites, such as Trivago, Kayak, and Momondo, offer the convenience of comparing prices from various hotels in one place. They often provide deals and discounts that may not be available on the hotel’s website. These platforms also offer user reviews, which can provide valuable insights into the quality of the hotel and its services.However, there are also downsides to using third-party sites. Sometimes, these platforms may not include all fees in the listed price, leading to unexpected costs at checkout. Additionally, reservations made through third-party sites are often non-refundable, and changes or cancellations can be difficult and costly.Why Hotels Use Third-Party SitesDespite the commission fees they have to pay to third-party sites, many hotels choose to list their rooms on these platforms for increased visibility. These sites attract a large audience, providing hotels with access to potential guests they might not reach otherwise. Third-party sites can also handle customer service and payment processing, reducing the workload for hotel staff.The Benefits of Booking DirectlyBooking directly with a hotel can offer several advantages. Hotels often reserve their best rooms for guests who book directly, and these guests may also be given priority for room upgrades. Direct bookings also allow for more flexibility in case of changes or cancellations.Moreover, many hotels offer loyalty programs with perks like free Wi-Fi, complimentary breakfast, or points for free stays, which are only available to guests who book directly. By booking directly, guests can also communicate their preferences or special requests directly to the hotel, ensuring a more personalized stay.The Role of Mobile Apps in Hotel SearchWith the rise of smartphones, mobile apps have become a significant player in the hotel search and booking process.

Let us now journey through the evolution of hotel and travel technology, highlighting the significant milestones that have shaped the industry we know today.The Dawn of Modern Hospitality (1800s – 1900s)The Tremont House, opened in Boston in 1829, is often regarded as the first modern hotel. It was the first of its kind to feature indoor plumbing for guests, setting a new standard for guest comfort and convenience. The late 1800s also saw the establishment of the first travel agency by Bernardo Abreu and the opening of the first hotel school in Lausanne, Switzerland.In the 1900s, hotels began to embrace technology in a big way. The Netherland Hotel in NYC introduced the first in-room telephones in 1894, and by 1910, electricity became widely prevalent in hotels. The Boston Park Plaza Hotel offered the first in-room radios in 1927, and the Roosevelt Hotel in NYC installed guest room TVs in 1947.The Rise of Automation and Digitalization (1950s – 1990s)The mid-20th century marked the beginning of automation in the hospitality industry. Westin debuted the first guest credit card in 1946 and established the first hotel reservation system in 1947. Howard Johnson became the first hotel to franchise in 1954, and Sheraton introduced the first hotel automated electronic reservation system and toll-free reservation phone number in 1957.The late 20th century saw the advent of digitalization in the hospitality industry.

Hotels often use multiple software solutions – Property Management Systems (PMS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools, Revenue Management Systems (RMS), and more. Ensuring that these systems communicate effectively with each other can be a daunting task. Without proper integration, data discrepancies can arise, leading to operational inefficiencies and guest dissatisfaction.Data Security ConcernsWith the increasing reliance on digital platforms, data security has become paramount. Hotels collect vast amounts of personal and financial data from their guests. Ensuring that this data is stored securely and is safe from cyber threats is crucial. A single data breach can tarnish a hotel’s reputation and result in significant financial losses.Keeping Up with Rapid Technological AdvancementsThe pace at which technology is evolving can be overwhelming. New software solutions and updates are released frequently. For hoteliers, keeping up with these changes and ensuring that their systems are up-to-date can be challenging. Outdated software can lead to operational inefficiencies and may not offer the features that modern guests expect.Training and AdaptabilityIntroducing a new software solution or updating an existing one requires training staff to use it effectively. The learning curve associated with new technology can lead to mistakes and operational hiccups. Ensuring that all staff members, from the front desk to housekeeping, are comfortable using the software is essential for smooth operations.High Costs and ROI ConcernsInvesting in top-tier hospitality softwares can be expensive. For many hotels, especially smaller establishments, the high costs associated with purchasing and maintaining software can be a deterrent. Moreover, hoteliers often grapple with concerns about the return on investment (ROI). Ensuring that the software leads to increased efficiency, enhanced guest experience, and ultimately, higher revenues is crucial.Customization and ScalabilityEvery hotel is unique, and a one-size-fits-all software solution may not address the specific needs of each establishment. Finding software that can be customized to suit a hotel’s requirements while also being scalable to accommodate growth can be challenging.Innovations in Hospitality Technology: Pioneering the Future of Guest ExperiencesThe hospitality industry, known for its commitment to guest satisfaction, has always been quick to adopt technological advancements. As we navigate the digital age, the innovations in hospitality technology are not just enhancing operations but are redefining the very essence of guest experiences. Let us now explore the latest technological breakthroughs that are setting new benchmarks in the industry.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ChatbotsAI has made significant inroads into the hospitality sector. Chatbots, powered by AI, are now a common feature on hotel websites and apps, providing instant responses to guest queries, facilitating bookings, and offering personalized recommendations. These virtual assistants ensure that guests receive immediate assistance, any time of the day.Internet of Things (IoT)The IoT is revolutionizing guest room experiences. From smart thermostats that adjust room temperatures based on guest preferences to voice-activated assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant, IoT devices are ensuring that guests have a seamless and personalized stay.Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)Imagine touring a hotel room or exploring a holiday destination before making a booking. VR and AR are making this possible. Hotels are using VR to offer virtual tours, while AR apps are enhancing guest experiences by providing interactive information about local attractions.MetaverseThe concept of the metaverse, although not fully understood yet, is anticipated to play a role in travel. It is expected to provide a more refined and engaging experience for travelers compared to AR and VR. Hotels such as the Millennium Hotels & Resorts have already opened the Metaverse hotel.Sustainable TechnologyWith growing environmental concerns, hotels are adopting sustainable travel technologies. From solar panels to water-saving devices, the focus is on reducing the carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly stays.Contactless SolutionsThe recent global events have accelerated the adoption of contactless technologies. Mobile check-ins, digital room keys, and contactless payments are ensuring guest safety without compromising on convenience.Biometric AuthenticationSecurity in the hospitality industry is paramount. Biometric authentication, using facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, is ensuring that access to rooms and hotel facilities is more secure than ever. This technology not only enhances security but also adds a touch of sophistication to the guest experience.Biometric Technology in Travel PaymentsFintech and payment companies will utilize biometric technologies to simplify travel-related payments, reducing disputes between service providers and customers. Touchless payment systems and non-cash financial credits like travel vouchers will gain popularity.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in HospitalityIn any industry, especially in hospitality, understanding and monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is crucial. These metrics provide insights into the performance of a hotel or hospitality business, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.Understanding the Most Crucial Hotel KPIsKPIs are quantifiable metrics that reflect the performance and health of a business. In the hospitality sector, some of the most critical KPIs or hospitality statistics include Occupancy Rate, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR).By monitoring these metrics, hoteliers can gauge their property’s success, identify areas of improvement, and strategize accordingly.How to Effectively Evaluate Hotel Performance Using These KPIsEvaluating hotel performance isn’t just about numbers; it’s about understanding what these numbers signify. For instance, a high occupancy rate might indicate strong demand, but if ADR and RevPAR are low, it could mean the hotel is underpricing its rooms. Using platforms and tools that offer insights can help hoteliers interpret these KPIs, compare them with industry benchmarks, and implement strategies to optimize performance.The Best Hospitality Software of 2023The hospitality sector has seen a surge in technological advancements in the lat few years. With the ever-evolving needs of guests and the challenges posed by external factors like the coronavirus pandemic, the industry is in dire need of robust software solutions.Features to Look for in Modern Hospitality SoftwareModern hospitality software is not just about reservations and billing.

This shift has led to an increased demand for software solutions that offer contactless operations, real-time room sanitization updates, and virtual concierge services. The industry’s pivot towards such solutions is not just a temporary change; it’s a long-term evolution that will define the future of hospitality.Benchmarking in the Hotel IndustryBenchmarking is the practice of comparing a hotel’s performance against industry standards or competitors. It provides hoteliers with a clearer picture of where they stand and what they need to improve.The Significance of Benchmarking for HoteliersIn the competitive world of hospitality, merely operating isn’t enough. Hoteliers need to know how they fare against their peers. Benchmarking provides this perspective. Whether it’s comparing occupancy rates, guest feedback scores, or any other KPI, benchmarking offers insights that can drive improvement.A lot of platforms today provide property- and portfolio-level insights that are crucial for making smart, data-driven decisions.Gaining Property- and Portfolio-Level Insights for Improved Decision-MakingWith such platforms and analytics dashboards, hoteliers can dive deep into data, analyzing performance at both property and portfolio levels. Such granularity helps in identifying trends, understanding guest preferences, and spotting areas of concern.For instance, if a particular property consistently underperforms in guest satisfaction, targeted interventions can be implemented. On the other hand, if a specific hotel chain sees a surge in bookings in a particular region, expansion strategies can be considered.Revenue Management in HospitalityRevenue management, often termed as yield management, is a strategic approach to pricing that aims to maximize a hotel’s revenue. In the hospitality industry, where demand can fluctuate significantly, understanding and implementing effective revenue management strategies is crucial.Best Practices for Hotel Revenue ManagementEffective revenue management goes beyond just setting room rates. It involves understanding market demand, analyzing competitor pricing, and leveraging seasonality.

65632728a3f6fc78b8eba0e0,-1348753968,How Hotels Can Stay Ahead in the Dynamic Hospitality Industry,"August 4, 2023","In today’s fast-paced and ever-evolving hospitality industry, staying competitive is crucial for hotels to thrive. With new trends, technologies, and guest expectations emerging, hoteliers must adopt innovative strategies to set themselves apart from the competition.So, how can hotels stay competitive in the hospitality industry? Well, let’s find out.Table of Contents1. Embrace Personalization for Memorable Guest ExperiencesIn an era where guests seek personalized experiences, hotels can differentiate themselves by tailoring services to individual preferences. Utilizing guest data and technology, hotels can curate unique experiences that cater to the specific needs and desires of each guest, enhancing guest satisfaction and fostering loyalty.Hotels must gather and analyze historical data to analyze behaviorPersonalization starts from the moment a guest engages with the hotel, be it through the website, mobile app, or online booking platform. By gathering and analyzing data on past stays, preferences, and behavior, hotels can anticipate guests’ needs and create tailor-made offers and recommendations. This level of personalization goes beyond addressing guests by name; it encompasses customizing room amenities, suggesting relevant local experiences, and even remembering dietary restrictions.Moreover, technology plays a significant role in enabling personalization.Advanced customer relationship management (CRM) systems and artificial intelligence (AI) tools can process vast amounts of data to provide valuable insights into guest preferences. For instance, AI-powered chatbots can engage with guests in real-time, understanding their queries and offering personalized responses, further enriching the guest experience.Strike the right balanceTo achieve meaningful personalization, hotels must strike a balance between leveraging data to create tailored experiences and respecting guest privacy. Being transparent about data usage and seeking explicit consent from guests for data collection are essential aspects of a successful personalization strategy.2. Leverage Technology to Optimize OperationsEfficient operations are essential to remain competitive. Embracing technology solutions such as property management systems, revenue management software, and data analytics can streamline processes, improve resource allocation, and boost overall operational efficiency.Use a PMSThe heart of any hotel’s operations lies in its property management system (PMS). A modern PMS goes beyond basic guest check-in and check-out functionalities; it acts as a centralized platform to manage reservations, housekeeping, billing, and more. Integration with other hotel systems, such as the point-of-sale (POS) system and CRM, enables seamless data flow, reducing manual errors and streamlining operations.Revenue management system is another critical tool for hotels to optimize revenue.By analyzing historical and real-time data on demand, competitor rates, and market trends, revenue management systems can dynamically adjust room prices to maximize revenue and occupancy. Implementing the right revenue management strategy ensures that hotels can sell the right room at the right price to the right customer at the right time.Data analytics plays a pivotal role in making informed decisions.By analyzing data from various sources, such as guest feedback, social media, and online reviews, hotels can identify trends and pain points, enabling them to make data-driven improvements to their services. Additionally, hotel data analytics can assist in predictive maintenance, optimizing energy consumption, and enhancing overall sustainability efforts.Furthermore, automation is a game-changer in hotel operations.Automating routine tasks like email communication, housekeeping schedules, and guest requests not only saves time but also allows staff to focus on delivering exceptional guest experiences.3. Prioritize Sustainability and Eco-Friendly PracticesEco-conscious travelers increasingly seek sustainable hotels and accommodations. Hotels can implement green initiatives, reduce waste, and embrace energy-efficient practices to attract environmentally conscious guests and align with evolving societal values.Sustainability is not just a trend but a pressing need for the future of the hospitality industry. Many travelers actively seek hotels that demonstrate a commitment to environmental responsibility and social impact. Implementing eco-friendly practices not only appeals to these eco-conscious guests but also reduces operating costs and enhances the hotel’s brand reputation.Hotels can take several steps to prioritize sustainability:By promoting their sustainable travel initiatives through marketing channels and online platforms, hotels can attract a growing segment of eco-conscious travelers while making a positive impact on the environment.4. Stay Agile and Adapt to Market TrendsThe hospitality industry is subject to constant change. Hotels that can swiftly adapt to emerging market trends and guest demands will be better equipped to seize opportunities and overcome challenges, ensuring long-term success. Market trends in the hospitality industry are driven by changing guest preferences, advancements in technology, global events, and shifts in travel behavior. For hotels to stay competitive, agility and adaptability are crucial.Hotels must continuously monitor industry trends and keep an eye on competitors’ strategies.Analyzing market data and customer feedback can reveal valuable insights into guest expectations and identify areas for improvement. A proactive approach to addressing guest needs ensures that hotels remain relevant and attractive to their target audience.Additionally, encouraging a culture of innovation can foster a spirit of continuous improvement.Embracing innovation does not necessarily mean implementing the latest technologies; it can also involve creative approaches to problem-solving, unique guest experiences, and forward-thinking service offerings.Moreover, hotels should be prepared to pivot their strategies and operations based on market shifts.For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many hotels swiftly adapted their services to cater to the rise in remote work and “workcations.” Being responsive to changing circumstances demonstrates the hotel’s commitment to guest satisfaction and positions it as a dependable and customer-centric choice.5. Invest in Employee Training and DevelopmentA well-trained and motivated staff is invaluable. Investing in employee training, empowerment, and recognition fosters a positive work culture that translates into superior guest service and an exceptional overall experience.Hotels must invest in operational trainings of the employeesHotels are built on the foundation of human interactions, and the expertise and dedication of the staff significantly impact the guest experience. Providing comprehensive training programs equips employees with the skills and knowledge needed to deliver top-notch service.Hotels must also invest in soft skill trainingsTrainings should not be limited to operational aspects but should also encompass soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Empowering employees to make decisions and resolve guest issues fosters a sense of ownership and accountability, leading to higher guest satisfaction and loyalty.Recognizing and rewarding outstanding employee performance is equally crucial.A culture of appreciation encourages employees to go the extra mile and take pride in their work. Employee recognition programs, incentive schemes, and career growth opportunities demonstrate that the hotel values its staff and invests in their success.Furthermore, fostering a positive work environment promotes employee retention and reduces turnover rates.Happy and engaged employees are more likely to remain with the hotel long-term, ensuring consistent service quality and a strong sense of teamwork.6. Capitalize on Guest Reviews and FeedbackPositive guest reviews and word-of-mouth referrals are potent marketing tools. Hotels must actively engage with guest feedback, address concerns, and leverage positive reviews to build credibility and trust among potential guests.Guest reviews and ratings heavily influence travelers’ booking decisions. Positive reviews not only attract potential guests but also play a crucial role in search engine rankings and online visibility.To effectively capitalize on guest reviews, hotels should:Encourage guest feedbackActively solicit guest reviews through post-stay surveys, email follow-ups, or on-site feedback stations. Offering incentives, such as loyalty points or discounts, can encourage guests to share their experiences.Respond to reviews promptlyAcknowledge and respond to guest reviews, both positive and negative. Addressing negative feedback with empathy and a willingness to resolve issues demonstrates the hotel’s commitment to guest satisfaction.Monitor online reputationRegularly monitor review platforms and social media channels to stay informed about guest feedback and sentiment. Addressing concerns in a timely manner helps prevent potential negative impacts on the hotel’s reputation.Showcase guest testimonialsFeature positive guest reviews on the hotel’s website, social media pages, and marketing materials. Authentic guest testimonials serve as powerful social proof and build trust with potential guests.However, managing online reviews extends beyond the hotel’s direct channels. Hotels must also keep a close eye on reviews posted on third-party booking platforms and travel review sites. Responding to reviews on these platforms demonstrates a commitment to guest service and encourages prospective guests to choose the hotel.7.

In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world, the art of hospitality has transformed into a structured discipline known as “Hospitality Management.” However, to master the art of hotel management in age of technology, it is important to understand its true essence, its relevance in modern times, and the pivotal role technology and AI play in refining the guest experience.Table of ContentsUnderstanding Hospitality ManagementAt its core, hospitality management revolves around two key pillars: guest satisfaction and smooth operations. The discipline encompasses a wide array of responsibilities, including guest services, housekeeping, front desk management, event planning, and more. Ensuring guests feel welcomed, comfortable, and valued is central to the art of hospitality. Moreover, behind the scenes, effective hospitality management involves coordinating staff, optimizing resource allocation, and maintaining seamless day-to-day operations.

6563272da3f6fc78b8eba0e4,1683231672,Has 'The Swiftie Fever' Opened New Travel Avenues In the U.S.,"August 1, 2023","In this high-profile music-pandemic world, the global music industry is experiencing a resurgence, with high-profile tours making a powerful comeback. Pop icons like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are no longer just entertainment figures – they are economic phenomena capable of significantly influencing consumption patterns in the cities they choose to tour. This article explores how pop culture, particularly these can’t-miss tours, along with the rise of “set jetting,” have and will continue to impact travel in 2023.Table of ContentsThe Frenzy of Concert TicketsWhen the dates for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour were announced in Australia, fans were in a frenzy to score tickets. Demand far exceeded supply, resulting in inflated prices from unregulated resales. The Australian government stepped in to prevent this practice and protect consumers, which highlights the tremendous impact that these worldwide tours have on both the economy and the cultural landscape of host cities.Despite the global economic downturn, Taylor Swift’s tour is projected to generate economic activity of $5 billion in the United States alone. This includes not only direct ticket sales bookings but also associated costs such as flights, hotel bookings and discretionary spending in the host cities. The tour is also expected to boost tourism, as fans travel to different venues around the world to see their favorite artists perform.Similarly, Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour had a significant impact on tourism in Stockholm, Sweden. The influx of Beyoncé fans, taking advantage of favorable exchange rates and affordable concert ticket prices, led to a surge in tourists and increased hotel prices. This spike contributed to inflationary pressures in Sweden, further illustrating the economic implications of these pop stars on tour.“Set Jetting”: Exploring Filming LocationsAlong with global concerts, “set jetting” has emerged as a popular travel trend. Set jetting references traveling to locations where popular movies or TV shows are or were filmed. Fans are willing to travel great distances to experience the magic of their favorite scenes in person. The destinations that serve as backdrops for iconic films or TV series are enjoying a significant increase in film-related tourism – and tourism boards around the world are taking notice. The success of the Emmy-winning TV series “Game of Thrones” led to a surge in visitors to locations such as Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Northern Ireland, where art destinations were filmed. The popular Max series, “The White Lotus” has been the catalyst for an influx of tourism in their filming locations in Hawaii and Sicily, Italy. Set-jetting enthusiasts are drawn to these often-picturesque destinations, creating a unique form of tourism that impacts local economies and travel demand.The Intersection of Music and Set JettingThe influence of pop music extends beyond concerts. Artists often choose unique and iconic locations for their music videos and album covers, which can also become sought-after destinations for fans. These locations gain recognition and attract visitors who want to experience the connection to their favorite artists.For instance, Taylor Swift’s music video for “Blank Space” was filmed at Oheka Castle in New York, and Beyoncé’s “Formation” video featured several distinct locations in New Orleans. Fans of these artists are often inspired to visit these places, immersing themselves in the music and culture they love.Impact of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour on Travel DemandSource: Adara, A RateGain CompanyAdara Hotel bookings data reflects a clear shift in leisure travel demand in Nashville with Taylor Swift’s Eras Music Tour. For 2023, the number of hotel bookings for leisure travel in Nashville followed a similar pattern as 2022 until mid-April. However, it had a remarkable growth in the 19th week of 2023, the same time as the tour dates – 5th to 7th of May. The hotel booking rose a few weeks prior to the event. However, as the tour to Nashville came to a conclusion, the travel demand didn’t slump. Rather, it rose further in the next few weeks. Similar surges in travel demand were observed for other tour locations as well.The Shift of Advance Period Booking Composition Towards Beyoncé’s Concert Date in StockholmSource: Adara, A RateGain CompanyThe flight booking patterns for Stockholm reflect that people traveled to the city in the 1st and 2nd week of May, coinciding with Beyoncé’s Tour to Stockholm. As the booking volume indicates, the advance booking composition showed a shift every month toward dates closer to the event in May. The majority of the bookings in February were made for travel dates 61-90 days in the future. But by April, the major composition of bookings was made for travel dates 15-30 days in the future. An overall rise in bookings was also observed as the date of Beyoncé’s tour came closer.\n\n Post-Pandemic Tourism and Travel DemandThe high demand for concert tickets and set-jetting experiences can largely be attributed to the lack of live music events and travel during the pandemic. With lockdowns and safety restrictions lifted, fans are eager to attend shows, explore filming locations, and travel to destinations related to their favorite artists and productions.In Singapore, students have even requested national holidays on concert days, highlighting the significance of these events for tourism. Additionally, set-jetting enthusiasts plan trips to immerse themselves in the world of their beloved films or TV shows. This renewed enthusiasm for travel, driven by popular culture, is expected to shape the travel landscape in 2023.Competition Among Countries and CitiesAs the economic benefits of live music and film tourism become evident, countries and cities are competing to attract these global events and productions. The positive impact on tourism, local businesses, and the overall economy are driving forces behind this competition. Governments and tourism boards are actively seeking opportunities to host major concerts, film festivals, and film productions to leverage the economic potential they bring. Many tourism boards and ministries of tourism have a complementary film tourism office, offering a variety of tax incentives to production teams.ConclusionPop culture, including high-profile tours featuring global pop icons like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, along with the rise of set-jetting, will profoundly impact travel in 2023. These global tours and the exploration of filming locations generate substantial economic activity in host cities and influence tourism, hotel occupancy, and even inflation rates. As the post-pandemic travel boom continues, fans are eager to attend concerts, explore iconic destinations, and immerse themselves in the world of their favorite artists and productions. In this new era, countries and cities will strive to attract global tours, film productions, and set-jetting experiences, recognizing the significant economic benefits they bring. The competition to secure these events and destinations will intensify, ultimately benefiting the tourism industry and driving economic growth. The impact of popular culture, combined with the jet-setting mentality of fans, creates a unique dynamic that will shape the travel landscape in the years to come.

These cutting-edge technologies are reshaping the way hotels and travel companies operate, enabling them to deliver personalized experiences, optimize revenue management, and streamline operations.Let us now delve into the exciting world of AI and ML, exploring who will lead the change in the hotel and travel sector and envisioning what the future holds as these technologies continue to shape the industry’s landscape.Table of ContentsLeveraging Open Technology and AIIn today’s rapidly evolving hospitality landscape, the integration of open technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving transformative changes in the hotel industry. As hoteliers seek to enhance guest experiences, optimize revenue management, and streamline operations, AI emerges as a powerful tool to achieve these objectives.Personalized Experiences and Enhanced Revenue ManagementAI-powered sales and distribution platforms have revolutionized how operators sell and manage inventory. Forward-thinking companies are redefining sales and distribution platforms through innovative data logic.

Data from B2C interactions provides valuable insights into guest preferences, behaviors, and booking patterns. This wealth of information enables hotels to understand their guests better and tailor offerings to meet their specific needs, thus delivering a more personalized experience. Additionally, it empowers hotels to optimize pricing strategies, drive revenue growth, and increase guest satisfaction without compromising on quality.Embracing AI and Machine Learning in Hotel IndustryThe adoption of AI and machine learning is redefining guest experiences in the hotel industry. Recommendation engines, powered by machine learning algorithms, offer personalized suggestions to guests based on their preferences, increasing the likelihood of conversion. Moreover, attribute-based selling allows hotels to offer a wide range of amenities and experiences tailored to individual guests’ needs, further enhancing guest satisfaction and revenue opportunities.Driving AI with Collaboration & PartnershipsTo keep up with the ever-evolving landscape of the hotel & travel industry, embracing technology is not just an option; it’s a necessity. As businesses strive to be transformative in their operations, one key aspect emerges as crucial to success: collaboration and partnerships. By coming together and fostering openness among stakeholders, the industry can address challenges, drive efficiency, and unlock the true potential of AI and ML technologies.Embracing Technology for Transformative ThinkingTechnology has already made a significant impact on various fronts, from empowering digital teams to enhancing OTA partnerships and B2B relationships. However, to truly revolutionize operations and distribution efforts, hoteliers must look inward and leverage the same technology to improve their efficiency and content creation.Collaboration and Innovation for Enhanced DistributionAcknowledging challenges and engaging in meaningful collaboration with technology partners can lead to innovative solutions that streamline distribution processes and improve content availability. By examining current practices and being open to reinvention, hoteliers can identify opportunities for enhancement, ultimately boosting their revenue and customer experiences.Onward Distribution and Leveraging Open TechnologyOpen technology plays a pivotal role in onward distribution, and leveraging it effectively can yield promising results. The implementation of caching to manage shopping loads and the use of data and machine learning to improve caching accuracy are among the practices that technology providers are employing to optimize distribution efforts.Simplifying Processes and Boosting EfficiencyCollaboration between supply, demand, and technology providers is essential to simplify processes and drive efficiency. From property onboarding to pricing intelligence, developing APIs and shared platforms can replace outdated and time-consuming methods like Excel spreadsheets, leading to smoother operations and better collaboration among industry professionals.Thus, there is the need for transformative thinking, collaboration, and leveraging technology to improve distribution, enhance content availability, and streamline operations in the hospitality industry. By combining product lines and expertise, companies can develop innovative solutions that benefit all parties involved and a better ecosystem for all involved.Personalized Experiences and Guest SatisfactionProviding personalized experiences has become key to a hotel’s success. Leveraging data and technology to cater to individual preferences and needs can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue for businesses in the industry.Delivering Outcomes: The Quest for PersonalizationOne of the primary goals for hoteliers and travel service providers is to deliver outcomes that align with individual customer preferences. By harnessing the power of analytics and data, businesses can gain valuable insights into their customers’ booking behavior, connectivity preferences, and more. This data-driven approach enables them to offer tailor-made packages and personalized experiences to customers, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction levels and increased revenue.The Need for Speed: Embracing Technological AdvancementsAs the travel industry evolves, speed becomes a critical factor in meeting customer demands. Waiting for lengthy development cycles is no longer an option in the fast-paced digital landscape. Businesses must adopt agile methodologies, where technological advancements occur in sprints of three to six months. By embracing a partnership-driven approach, hotels and travel service providers can collaborate with technology vendors to expedite the implementation of new solutions and improve their onward distribution environment.Challenges in Achieving PersonalizationWhile the desire for personalized experiences is evident, achieving true personalization remains a challenge. One of the key barriers is the availability of open APIs and seamless integrations. Startups and businesses seeking personalization solutions often face hurdles in connecting with multiple partners due to the need for commercial agreements and partnerships. Addressing these challenges and establishing a robust ecosystem of interconnected technologies is crucial for unlocking the true potential of personalized offerings.Understanding Context: The Key to Effective PersonalizationTruly personalized experiences go beyond offering a one-size-fits-all solution. Understanding the context in which travelers make their bookings is paramount. A routine trip might require a simple, familiar booking process, while an annual vacation demands a more thorough analysis of preferences and details. Utilizing AI and machine learning technologies can help decipher and respond to the context of each booking, streamlining decision-making and enhancing customer satisfaction.Removing Friction: A Gateway to ValueGuest experience remains at the heart of the hospitality industry. Removing friction from the booking process is crucial to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for travelers. By investing in innovative technologies and prioritizing partnerships with industry-leading players, hotels and travel service providers can eliminate pain points and offer a value-driven experience, which, in turn, drives customer loyalty and positive reviews.Personalizing Content: Still a Work in ProgressWhile technology has made great strides in personalizing content, there is a consensus that we haven’t fully achieved the concept of personalized pricing yet. However, it is evident that we are heading in the right direction, with content personalization leading the way.Demand Partners and OTAs: Driving PersonalizationDemand partners, particularly Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), have been at the forefront of personalization. Their advantage lies in their superior technology and a diverse user base that shops for a wide range of products. This abundance of user data allows them to craft customized and well-merchandised offerings.The Unique Advantage of OTAsUnlike hotel chains, which often have a limited audience interested only in their specific brand, OTAs can cater to users who have varied interests, such as flights, car rentals, and different hotel chains. This vast array of data points enables OTAs to fine-tune their personalization efforts to suit individual preferences better.Personalized Shopping ExperienceWhen logged into an OTA shopping session, users witness a completely different experience in terms of product sorting and merchandise. This personalized approach showcases the speed at which the industry is progressing in delivering tailored solutions.Towards Tailor-Made PackagingMoving forward, the industry is committed to achieving tailor-made packaging. By identifying unique characteristics of different booking requests, companies aim to provide offerings that make sense for individual users. Previous transaction data and historical confirmations play a crucial role in building these personalized packages.The Limitations of Personalization in Hotel IndustryWhile personalization holds tremendous promise, it’s essential to avoid creating echo chambers. Striking a balance between customization and over-personalization remains crucial to ensure users are delighted by the experience rather than feeling overwhelmed.Impact of AI on Job Roles in the Hospitality IndustryArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword in various industries, including distribution. As technology continues to advance, concerns arise about the potential impact on job roles and workforce dynamics.AI and Job SecurityOne of the most common worries among professionals in the distribution industry is whether AI will replace their jobs entirely. However, experts suggest that AI is more likely to transform job roles rather than eliminate them. While mundane tasks might become automated, there will always be a need for human expertise in certain areas, especially those that require a personal touch or complex decision-making.The Need for AI EducationAs AI technology continues to evolve, staying informed and educated about AI becomes essential. Those who embrace AI and learn to leverage its potential are likely to find themselves at an advantage. On the other hand, those who resist or ignore AI may find themselves falling behind. Continuous learning and upskilling will be crucial for professionals to stay relevant in the changing landscape.Enhancing Efficiency and Job FacilitationAI is undeniably a powerful tool that can significantly enhance efficiency and productivity in the distribution industry. By automating repetitive tasks, professionals can focus on more critical aspects of their work, such as improving customer experiences or devising strategic plans. AI-driven tools can streamline processes like onboarding hotels and summarizing data, making the workflow smoother and more effective.Differentiation through AI AdoptionCompanies that embrace AI and implement it effectively gain a competitive edge in the market. Those who are quick to adapt to AI technology will outperform their competitors who do not leverage its capabilities. For instance, AI can be instrumental in automating revenue management systems and optimizing pricing strategies, ultimately leading to increased market share and revenue.Focusing on Customer ExperienceAs certain tasks become automated, businesses will have more resources and time to devote to enhancing the overall customer experience. By freeing up human capital from mundane tasks, companies can shift their attention to personalized service and addressing customer needs more effectively. This focus on customer satisfaction can create a significant advantage in a highly competitive industry.The Ethical Dimension of AIWhile AI promises numerous benefits, discussions about ethics are vital. As AI technology advances, it is essential to ensure that its implementation aligns with ethical guidelines and respects privacy and human rights. Addressing ethical concerns will play a crucial role in building trust and acceptance among both industry professionals and customers.The Future of AI and ML in Travel IndustryThe future of the hotel and travel industry lies in embracing the AI revolution wholeheartedly. Those who proactively adopt AI technologies and leverage its capabilities will thrive in a dynamic and competitive market. Embracing AI and ML enables businesses to unlock new revenue streams, enhance guest experiences, and optimize operations for greater profitability. The AI-powered future is a world of limitless possibilities, where innovation and creativity know no bounds.Concluding RemarksAI and ML are poised to lead a transformative change in the travel and hospitality industry. With their ability to deliver personalized experiences, optimize revenue management, and streamline operations, these technologies offer immense potential for growth and innovation.

65632733a3f6fc78b8eba0ec,689474356,The Basics of Distribution for Hotel Chains,"July 18, 2023","Welcome to the digital era, where big hotel chains face the exhilarating challenge of crafting a distribution strategy that caters to the needs of modern consumers. However, an effective distribution strategy can skyrocket profitability for big hotels.However, before we talk about the strategies for success, let us dive into the obstacles these chains encounter.Table of ContentsThe Digital Marketplace: Where the Battle BeginsAs the world becomes increasingly digital, big hotel chains find themselves amid fierce competition. With online booking platforms like Expedia, Booking.com, and Airbnb at the forefront, consumers have easy access to an array of accommodation options.These platforms offer enticing benefits, such as seamless comparison shopping, customer reviews, and loyalty programs, which are tough for hotels to replicate on their own websites.Navigating the Web of PartnershipsManaging relationships with a complex network of distribution partners poses yet another challenge for hotel chains. From travel agencies to wholesalers and online booking platforms, hotels must skillfully navigate a web of partnerships to ensure effective marketing and sales of their inventory.The Profitability Puzzle: Balancing Direct & Third-Party SalesEnsuring that all distribution channels work harmoniously to maximize revenue and profitability is crucial. However, with multiple partners involved, tracking inventory and pricing across all channels becomes a daunting task. This can lead to lost revenue and decreased profitability. Finding the perfect balance between direct sales and third-party sales is key to identifying which partners bring the most value to your hotel.To overcome these challenges, big hotel chains must develop a comprehensive distribution strategy that harnesses the latest technology and partnerships to maximize revenue and profitability. Here’s my four-point recommended framework.Embrace the Power of Central Reservation SystemsInvesting in central reservation systems and distribution solutions that effectively manage inventory and pricing across all channels is a game-changer. These systems streamline operations, empowering big hotel chains to efficiently manage reservations, availability, and rates.The result? Increased revenue, cost savings, and the ability to leverage valuable data insights, all from a single extranet.Forge Strong PartnershipsEstablishing strong partnerships with key distribution players is another crucial solution. By developing direct relationships between hotels, wholesalers, and online booking platforms, chains can ensure their inventory is effectively marketed and sold.Embrace the Digital Transformation for Seamless Booking ExperienceLeveraging the latest technology is paramount in creating a personalized booking experience that modern consumers crave. Invest in mobile apps, chatbots, loyalty programs, and other digital tools to offer a frictionless booking process. By seamlessly integrating these innovations, hotels can delight their guests and stay ahead of the competition.Adapt, Innovate, and ThriveIn this digital era, big hotel chains must adapt to the changing landscape and embrace innovative solutions to stay competitive.

65632734a3f6fc78b8eba0ee,-1180924705,Supercharging Hotel Bookings: The Game-Changing Benefits of Metasearch Marketing,"July 18, 2023","In the ever-evolving world of travel marketing, metasearch has emerged as a game-changing tool for hotel chains. It provides travelers with a platform to compare hotel prices and options, making it an essential resource for those who have narrowed down their travel plans and are ready to book.Not only does metasearch drive additional qualified traffic, but it also boasts high conversion rates. What’s more, it holds the promise of being a critical channel in the future, as it does not rely on third-party cookies that will become obsolete in 2024. By leveraging metasearch, hotel chains can secure direct bookings on their brand websites, thereby owning the customer relationship, capturing valuable first-party data, and creating exceptional customer experiences.Let’s dive deeper into the benefits of metasearch marketing and the business value that it brings to hotel chains.Table of ContentsBenefits of Metasearch Marketing for Hotel ChainsAttract New Customers through Metasearch ChannelsMetasearch users are adventurous and eager to explore new experiences. They actively seek a hotel that aligns with their unique needs, making them open to trying different brands. This means that many bookings made through metasearch channels come from new customers. Therefore, metasearch becomes a powerful driver of incremental traffic and expands your customer base.Drive Direct Bookings with Metasearch MarketingOnce a potential guest discovers your hotel listing through metasearch, you, as the advertiser, gain control over the customer experience. This presents a golden opportunity to build a meaningful relationship and encourage direct bookings, eliminating the need for intermediaries like resellers or travel agencies. By fostering a direct booking environment, hotel chains can maximize revenue and strengthen their brand presence.Improve Marketing Efficiency with Metasearch CampaignsMetasearch is known to be one of the most efficient digital acquisition channels available to hotel chains. With effective management and strategy, metasearch campaigns enhance the efficiency of your overall digital marketing investment. This, in turn, leads to a higher impact and a reliable return on ad spend, allowing you to optimize your marketing resources.Prevent Bleeding Money on Booking CommissionsThe way guests search for hotel rooms online has changed dramatically. If your direct prices do not appear in metasearch results, or if you find that your rates are consistently undercut by online travel agencies (OTAs), you will continue to pay high commissions on bookings that you could have won directly. However, with a well-executed metasearch management solution, you can reduce your reliance on OTAs and gain more control over acquiring new guests.Acquire Guests Efficiently and Cost-EffectivelyMetasearch has earned a reputation for being an expensive channel, but when used intelligently, it can deliver a greater return on investment than OTAs. Additionally, every metasearch booking is valuable not only for the initial transaction but also for the potential lifetime value of the guest. By capturing guests through metasearch, hotel chains gain complete ownership of the booking and can immediately begin building a lasting relationship with the guest, nurturing future loyalty and repeat visits.Now that we’ve explored the benefits, let’s discuss some key features to consider when selecting a metasearch solution.Key Considerations while Choosing a Metasearch SolutionSeamless Integration & ConnectivityTo ensure a seamless experience, it’s crucial to choose a vendor that offers the right integrations. These integrations should support your team’s success and adapt to any new requirements set by meta channels. Without proper distribution and connectivity, your visibility and quality scores may suffer.Robust Reporting of Metasearch CampaignsMetasearch campaigns generate vast amounts of data, often consisting of hundreds of thousands of data points and complex bidding layers. To effectively navigate this wealth of information, you need access to robust reporting tools. These tools should be customizable, align with your internal metrics and business goals, and provide insights that drive informed decision-making.Custom Labels for Metasearch Marketing CampaignsWhen managing metasearch campaigns for numerous properties, labeling, or tagging features become essential. They allow campaign managers to automate and group properties based on custom values. Labels provide a valuable organizational tool for your campaigns and enable the identification of trends and patterns.Property Content ManagementDetailed reporting informed by rich property-level data is a game-changer for hotel chains. It adds geographic context to broader reports and facilitates granular analysis by incorporating specific hotel attributes. By leveraging property content management capabilities, you can gain valuable insights into your marketing performance.Intelligent TargetingAudience targeting is a vital aspect of successful metasearch campaigns. The ability to segment your campaigns by specific customer groups or demographics is crucial for reaching your target audience effectively. Look for a metasearch solution that empowers you to tailor your ads to the right customers at the right time.Real-time Bid Updates Based on Full-Funnel DataWhile hotels may not be able to match the budget of OTAs, they can compete by understanding their guests better and applying this knowledge to bidding strategies. Intelligent metasearch software allows for real-time bid updates based on onsite behavioral data and insights into the value of each trip. This approach ensures that you bid appropriately to attract the right guests at the right price, driving high-volume traffic while maintaining a strong return on ad spend.Parity BlackoutsIt’s essential for hotels to avoid paying to advertise rates that are lower on OTAs. By incorporating live parity data into your bidding strategy, you can bid confidently knowing that you offer the best rate. This approach maximizes bid efficiency and protects your brand’s integrity.In conclusion, metasearch is an invaluable tool for hotel chains aiming to generate direct bookings and position themselves in front of travelers at the moment they are ready to make a booking decision. To ensure a seamless and successful metasearch marketing strategy, it is crucial to choose the right software solution that offers connectivity, robust reporting, customizable targeting and bidding capabilities, and the ability to optimize bids in real time.About the AuthorChristiane Sieveking\n\nVP – Commercial, Europe\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/benefits-of-metasearch-marketing/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Game-Changing-Benefits-of-Metasearch-Marketing.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Game-Changing-Benefits-of-Metasearch-Marketing.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Christiane-1-150x150.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Metasearch Marketing,,,,,,,0
65632735a3f6fc78b8eba0f0,2044333714,The Tech-Stack Needed by OTAs to Scale Your BI Capabilities,"July 17, 2023","In the highly competitive world of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), the ability to extract actionable insights from vast volumes of data is crucial for achieving sustained success. With the exponential growth of digital transactions, OTAs face the challenge of efficiently managing and leveraging data to drive business intelligence.However, to overcome these challenges, OTAs can implement effective strategies to improve business intelligence in high volumes, focusing on leveraging big data analytics and streamlining data management processes.Table of ContentsInvesting in Robust Data InfrastructureTo handle the high volumes of data generated by OTAs, investing in a robust data infrastructure is paramount. Implementing scalable and flexible technologies, such as cloud-based storage solutions and distributed processing frameworks, enables OTAs to handle massive amounts of data efficiently. Additionally, employing data compression techniques and data partitioning methodologies can optimize storage and retrieval processes, enhancing overall system performance.Embracing Big Data AnalyticsLeveraging big data analytics is crucial for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets. By employing advanced analytics tools and techniques, OTAs can uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that drive customer behavior and preferences. Machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics models enable OTAs to forecast demand, personalize recommendations, and optimize pricing strategies, ultimately leading to increased revenue.Implementing Real-time Data ProcessingIn the fast-paced world of online travel, real-time data processing is a game-changer. By analyzing data as it is generated, OTAs can make timely and informed decisions. Implementing real-time data processing frameworks allows OTAs to monitor customer interactions, track inventory availability, and respond swiftly to market dynamics. This agility enables OTAs to seize opportunities and address issues promptly, ensuring a competitive edge in the industry.Establishing a Unified Data RepositoryData silos can hinder effective business intelligence. Establishing a unified data repository, where data from various sources is centralized, ensures a single source of truth. A well-designed data warehouse or a data lake enables OTAs to integrate and analyze data from multiple channels, including website interactions, bookings, customer reviews, and social media sentiment. This consolidated view of data provides comprehensive insights into customer behavior and facilitates accurate decision-making.Ensuring Data Quality and GovernanceHigh-quality data is the foundation of reliable business intelligence. OTAs should prioritize data quality by implementing data cleansing and validation processes. Regular data audits and quality checks help identify inconsistencies and inaccuracies, ensuring data integrity. Additionally, establishing robust data governance practices, including data access controls, data privacy measures, and compliance with regulatory requirements, is essential for maintaining trust and credibility with customers.Fostering Cross-functional CollaborationEffective business intelligence requires collaboration across different teams within an OTA. Encouraging cross-functional collaboration between data analysts, marketing teams, product managers, and customer service representatives facilitates a holistic understanding of data insights. Regular meetings, knowledge sharing sessions, and collaborative projects help break down silos and foster a data-driven culture throughout the organization.Continuously Monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of business intelligence initiatives. OTAs should identify relevant KPIs, such as conversion rates, customer acquisition costs, and customer lifetime value, and track them regularly. Real-time dashboards and automated reporting tools enable OTAs to monitor KPIs and identify areas for improvement promptly. Data-driven insights from KPI monitoring help optimize operations and drive strategic decision-making.Data Visualization and ReportingPresenting data in a visually appealing and easily understandable format enhances its impact. Effective data visualization techniques, such as charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards, allow OTAs to communicate complex information succinctly. Well-designed reports and visualizations enable stakeholders to quickly grasp insights and make data-driven decisions. Investing in user-friendly data visualization tools empowers non-technical users to explore data independently and gain valuable insights.In conclusion, improving business intelligence in high volumes for OTAs requires a strategic approach to data management and analysis. With a data-driven culture and a focus on continuous monitoring and visualization, OTAs can harness the full potential of business intelligence to thrive in the dynamic online travel industry.About the AuthorEduardo Real\n\nEnterprise Account Director\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/tech-stack-needed-by-otas/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Techology-Stack-Needed-by-OTAs.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Techology-Stack-Needed-by-OTAs.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Eduardo-Real-Enterprise-Account-Director-150x150.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,hotel technology,OTAs,thought leadership,,,,,0
65632737a3f6fc78b8eba0f2,1290358918,The Future of Rate Parity in the Hospitality Industry,"July 17, 2023","In the dynamic hospitality landscape, maintaining rate parity remains a critical concern for the hoteliers. What is rate parity? Nothing but the practice of selling equal rates across all distribution channels, including direct booking websites, OTAs, and offline sales channels.Rate parity is key to ensuring fair competition as it guarantees that consumers receive consistent pricing, regardless of the channel through which they book. However, hoteliers must overcome some obstacles to preserve it.Table of ContentsRate leakage is one of the main challenges that hoteliers face.It occurs when unauthorized channels offer lower rates without the property’s consent, leading to rate disparities and eroding trust in the industry.Hoteliers also face direct booking challenges.They strive to encourage direct bookings through their websites to reduce reliance on third-party channels. However, providing exclusive benefits or discounts to direct bookers without violating rate parity can be hard.Hoteliers find it difficult to maintain parity across different distribution channels.OTAs usually put pressure on hoteliers to provide lower rates or exclusive discounts in exchange for a better positioning on their platforms. This pressure can make it difficult for hoteliers to maintain rate parity across all distribution channels.Furthermore, rate parity regulations vary across different regions and countries.This is why maintaining global compliance can be difficult, especially for hotel chains operating in multiple destinations.Here are some solutions for addressing the challenges mentioned above.Focus on Personalization and Value-Added BenefitsTo incentive direct bookings without violating rate parity, hotels can focus on guest experiences and unique value-added benefits for direct bookers. By offering these unique perks, it will incentivize guests to choose the hotel’s official website over third-party channels.Invest in Technology SolutionsThere are different tools that can help hoteliers automate rate parity monitoring and management. Real-time rate tracking and automated alerts can help in identifying and rectifying rate disparities promptly. There are even some advanced tools that provide test booking services, which helps hoteliers identifying which wholesalers and bed banks have distributed offline rates to online channels, also giving the possibility to notify those directly from the platform.Collaborative PartnershipsBuilding strong relationships with distribution partners, including OTAs, is key since it will help address rate parity challenges. Negotiating fair contracts and fostering open communication can encourage cooperation and ensure consistency across channels.Rate parity remains a crucial aspect of the hospitality industry, ensuring fair competition, brand integrity, and customer satisfaction. Overcoming challenges such as rate leakage, OTA pressure, and direct booking complexities requires a proactive approach. By embracing advanced technology, fostering collaborative partnerships, and prioritizing personalization and value-added benefits, hoteliers can navigate these challenges and maintain rate parity across distribution channels.The future of rate parity in the hospitality industry lies in finding a balance between maintaining consistency and adapting to evolving market dynamics. And if you are looking to solve your rate parity problems, we are happy to help.About the AuthorCristina Santamaría\n\nHotel Solutions Manager\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/future-of-rate-parity-in-the-hospitality-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Future-of-rate-parity-in-hospitality.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Future-of-rate-parity-in-hospitality.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cristina-Santamaria-Hotel-Solutions-Manager-150x150.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Blog,,,Rate intelligence,Rate parity,thought leadership,,,,,0
65632738a3f6fc78b8eba0f4,1005610455,How Hotel Pricing is Going to Change in the Age of AI,"July 12, 2023","Imagine a world where your hotel knows what a guest wants even before they do. A world where your pricing strategy is not just about numbers, but about understanding choices, dreams, and the urge to travel. A world where your revenue management and marketing teams work hand in hand to craft personalized offers that guests can’t resist. Sounds utopian right? Well, with Artificial Intelligence (AI), this dream is becoming a reality.Over the last few months, we have seen ChatGPT, Bard and other travel-technology companies use Large Language models to fundamentally alter the way travelers looked for inspiration, searched for options and how they planned travel. The two-decade old process of searching for options in silos finally appears to be broken – and a near human like conversational experience is now being created where travelers can share an abstract vision of the type of travel they want to experience and the LLM powered bots will share the closest matches to their vision.Table of ContentsPersonalizing Pricing with AIAI is enabling a new level of personalization in the hospitality industry. By analyzing vast amounts of data quickly, AI can understand individual preferences, needs, and the urge to travel, allowing hotels to tailor their offerings to each guest. This level of personalization enhances the guests’ experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.For instance, AI when coupled with a language model, can not only understand past booking behaviors but also preferences for future stays. This could range from their preferred room type and amenities to their dietary preferences and activities of interest. By personalizing the guest experience in this manner, hotels can not only enhance guest satisfaction but also maximize their revenue by upselling personalized services and offerings.While hoteliers might see this as an additional layer of complexity, the right way to see it as an opportunity to differentiate their offerings not only within the hotel, but even before the guest has made the decision to book with them. The level of customization also allows them to charge a premium depending on the type of property the revenue management team is handling.Making TRevPAR a success with AIAI as most of you might understand is the layer that sits on top of all the data that is collected. This collected data allows the AI to stay informed, build context and suggest solutions or alternatives that can work in the real world. An application of that use case in hospitality is providing recommendations to end travelers and helping them have better experience, as well as connect with PMS systems to understand and tackle guest queries.For instance, an AI assistant can understand a user’s query, provide relevant information, and even suggest personalized recommendations. This not only enhances the user experience but also reduces the workload on customer service teams, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks.With AI being able to provide prompt response and service, this allows the opportunity to upsell and create room for generating higher revenues.However, based on consumption patterns – in the future when guests return to book with a certain chain, the chain can nudge the user to add on the ancillaries he ordered at a discount – ensuring that the extra revenue is guaranteed as well as the guest also feels they are able to get a good price for the add on.In addition to this, using AI hotels can drive more traffic to their apps or website as that is where you can serve the offer, and not on the OTA. The Blurring Lines between Marketing and Revenue TeamsWith the rise of hyper-personalization, the lines between revenue management and marketing are blurring. Revenue managers are no longer just setting prices based on supply and demand. They are now working closely with marketing teams to understand what the right offer is for each individual customer.For instance, by analyzing a customer’s booking history and online behavior, revenue managers and marketing teams can determine the types of offers and promotions that the customer is most likely to respond to. This could range from discounted rates and package deals to personalized add-ons and services.In this context, the role of revenue managers is evolving from simply setting prices to crafting personalized offers that maximize both customer satisfaction and revenue.So, What can You Do?As AI continues to evolve, so will the role of revenue managers as the trip planning and booking process undergoes a massive change.Revenue managers will need to understand and leverage AI to craft personalized pricing strategies, work closely with marketing teams to understand customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue.Remember, the advent of AI is not a threat to revenue managers, but an opportunity. It’s an opportunity to enhance their strategies, provide more personalized experiences to guests, and ultimately, drive more revenue. As we move into the future, the role of revenue managers will be more important than ever, and those who can adapt and leverage AI will be at the forefront of the industry.About the AuthorMudasser Tariq\n\nSenior Vice President – Enterprise Business\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/hotel-pricing-ai/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/HOW-PRICING-WILL-CHANGE-IN-the-AGE-OF-AI.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/HOW-PRICING-WILL-CHANGE-IN-the-AGE-OF-AI.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/muddaser-tariq-150x150.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,AI,Revenue Management,thought leadership,,,,,0

Hoteliers can track specific events such as bookings, form submissions, or video views. This enables them to understand user behavior at a more detailed level, optimize conversion funnels, and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. Hoteliers can gain insights into how users engage with their website, identify potential bottlenecks in the booking process, and make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and drive more bookings.Enhanced Cross-Device TrackingGA4 offers enhanced cross-device tracking capabilities compared to UA. With the proliferation of multiple devices used by travelers throughout their journey, it is crucial for hoteliers to understand how users interact with their website across different devices.Impact on Hoteliers: The enhanced cross-device tracking in GA4 allows hoteliers to track user interactions seamlessly across devices. Hoteliers can gain a comprehensive view of the customer journey and attribute conversions accurately. For example, if a user initially visits a hotel’s website on their mobile device but completes the booking on their desktop, GA4 can attribute the conversion to the appropriate source and provide insights into the user’s behavior across devices. This enables hoteliers to optimize marketing campaigns, personalize user experiences, and maximize conversions across different devices.Machine Learning and Predictive AnalyticsGA4 leverages machine learning algorithms to provide predictive analytics capabilities.

Hoteliers can leverage these insights to optimize their marketing campaigns, allocate resources effectively, and target the right audience segments. This capability enables hoteliers to stay ahead of the competition, improve campaign ROI, and drive more bookings.Deeper User InsightsGA4 captures more granular data on user interactions compared to its predecessor. Hoteliers can gain insights into user behavior such as scroll depth, video engagement, and file downloads.Impact on Hoteliers: These insights help hoteliers understand user preferences, identify areas for improvement, and tailor their website and marketing strategies accordingly. For instance, by analyzing scroll depth data, hoteliers can determine if users are engaging with their content or if there are specific sections that need improvement. This allows them to optimize the layout, structure, and placement of content to maximize user engagement.Simplified Data ReportingGA4 offers a more user-friendly interface and simplified reporting, making it easier for hoteliers to access and analyze data.

6563273fa3f6fc78b8eba0fc,-1224947614,Managing Hotel Cancellations: Strategies to Optimize Revenue and Guest Satisfaction,"June 28, 2023","Hotel cancellations are an inherent challenge in the hospitality industry, impacting both revenue and operational efficiency. Whether due to unforeseen circumstances, changing travel plans, or other factors, cancellations can disrupt a hotel’s occupancy and revenue forecasts. However, by implementing proactive measures and adopting best practices, hotels can mitigate revenue loss, optimize inventory management, and enhance overall guest satisfaction.Let us delve into the challenges associated with managing cancellations in hotels and explore effective strategies to minimize their impact.Table of ContentsUnderstanding the Causes of Hotel CancellationsHotel cancellations can stem from various factors, and understanding these causes is crucial in developing effective strategies to manage them. Some common causes of hotel cancellations include travel uncertainties, changes in personal plans, dissatisfaction with booking details, or unforeseen emergencies. Guests may also cancel due to better offers or promotions from competing hotels. By analyzing cancellation patterns and guest feedback, hotels can identify the specific reasons behind cancellations and tailor their strategies accordingly.Managing Hotel Cancellations for Successful OperationsImplementing Flexible Hotel Cancellation PoliciesImplementing flexible cancellation policies is a key approach to reducing cancellation rates. By offering guests the option to cancel their reservations within a specified window without incurring any penalties, hotels can accommodate changes in travel plans and address uncertainties. Flexible policies not only enhance guest satisfaction but also incentivize them to retain their bookings rather than canceling. Additionally, providing the option for refunds or credits can encourage guests to reschedule their stays instead of canceling altogether.Optimizing Revenue through OverbookingStrategic overbooking is a revenue optimization tactic that hotels can employ to counterbalance cancellations. By analyzing historical data, booking patterns, and cancellation trends, hotels can forecast the likelihood of cancellations and allocate a controlled number of overbookings. This practice helps maximize occupancy and revenue even in the face of cancellations. However, it requires careful monitoring and management to ensure a balanced approach that avoids excessive overbooking, which can lead to guest dissatisfaction.Encouraging Direct BookingsDirect bookings can help reduce cancellations influenced by third-party booking platforms and increase hotel revenue. Hotels can incentivize guests to book directly through their official websites or call centers by offering exclusive perks, discounts, or loyalty program benefits. By highlighting the advantages of booking directly, such as guaranteed reservations, personalized services, and better cancellation flexibility, hotels can encourage guests to bypass third-party channels, which are more prone to cancellations.Leveraging Technology and Data Analytics for Hotel Cancellation ManagementAdvanced technology solutions and data analytics play a crucial role in managing hotel cancellations effectively. By leveraging guest data, booking patterns, and historical trends, hotels can develop predictive models that identify potential cancellations in advance. This enables them to take proactive measures to retain bookings, such as offering alternative dates, room upgrades, or personalized incentives. Additionally, sophisticated revenue management systems and analytics tools can provide real-time insights into cancellation patterns and help hotels make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and minimize cancellations.Role of Effective Communication and Customer Service in Managing Hotel CancellationsEffective communication is paramount in managing cancellations and maintaining guest satisfaction. Hotels should establish efficient communication channels, such as dedicated cancellation helplines or email addresses, to promptly address guest concerns and provide assistance. Clear and transparent communication about cancellation policies, refund processes, and alternative options is essential to alleviate guest anxieties and ensure a smooth experience. Proactive communication, both before and after cancellations, can help salvage bookings and build guest loyalty. By demonstrating empathy, offering suitable alternatives, and providing exceptional customer service, hotels can mitigate the impact of cancellations and foster positive guest relationships.By adopting a comprehensive approach and utilizing the right tools and strategies, hotels can navigate the challenges of cancellations and optimize their overall performance in the competitive hospitality industry.",https://rategain.com/blog/managing-hotel-cancellations/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Managing-Cancellations-to-Optimize-Revenue-_-Guest-Satisfaction.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Managing-Cancellations-to-Optimize-Revenue-_-Guest-Satisfaction.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Inventory Management,Revenue Management,,,,,,0

Well, the hospitality industry has seen some major transformations in recent years, all thanks to the rise of digital technology. While these advancements have created new opportunities for hoteliers, they’ve also brought along some challenges that need to be tackled head-on.One of the key challenges is ensuring effective distribution, which plays a vital role in the success of hotels. With a highly competitive landscape and the dominance of online travel agencies (OTAs) and digital platforms, hotels need a little help in managing their distribution channels.But before talking more about the solutions, let us dive into the challenges faced in distribution.Table of ContentsOne major hurdle is dealing with fragmented distribution channels.Nowadays, hotels have to deal with numerous distribution channels such as OTAs, global distribution systems (GDS), tour operators, metasearch engines, and direct bookings. It’s a complex and time-consuming task to ensure consistent rates, availability, and content across all these channels. It requires constant monitoring and coordination to effectively manage multiple channels without things getting too complicated.Another challenge is maintaining rate parity and price transparency.It can be quite a struggle to keep rates consistent across all distribution channels. The last thing hotels want is rate disparities that can lead to unhappy customers and lost bookings. To tackle this challenge, hotels must have a rate management strategy in place and regularly monitor the channels to ensure rate parity. This way, they can maintain trust and a fair competitive environment.Inventory control and overbookings are also crucial areas that need attention.It’s extremely important to have accurate inventory management to avoid overselling or underselling rooms. With a centralized system in place, hotels can minimize the risk of overbooking and easily manage and optimize their distributions.To address overbookings, hotels need robust inventory control systems and forecasting solutions. These tools help estimate demand accurately and allocate resources effectively.Given the challenging distribution landscape, the question that arises is – how can hotels overcome these challenges to drive business growth?One of the key solutions is adopting a robust distribution management system.This allows hotels to streamline operations and manage multiple channels from a single platform. With a centralized control system, hotels can enhance operational efficiency, minimize errors, and ensure consistency across distribution channels. Companies like RateGain offer a centralized Distribution Management platform that automates the distribution process, making it easier for hotels to manage their distribution effectively.Channel integration and connectivity are also vital.Connecting with various distribution channels through a channel manager enables real-time updates on rates and availability. Integration eliminates the need for manual data entry, reducing errors and ensuring accurate information across platforms.RateGain’s channel management solution offers seamless connectivity with various distribution channels, including OTAs, GDS, metasearch engines, and more. Real-time updates ensure that rates and availability are accurate across all channels, maximizing visibility and potential bookings.It also integrates with leading Property Management System (PMS) platforms, facilitating efficient data exchange and synchronization between systems. This integration ensures accurate and up-to-date information across all operations, including the front desk, reservations, and revenue management.Hotels should implement dynamic pricing and revenue management strategies.To optimize pricing and revenue, hotels should implement dynamic pricing and revenue management strategies. Automated revenue management systems analyze market demand and competitor rates, allowing hotels to adjust prices dynamically for different channels and segments.Data analytics plays a crucial role in optimizing distribution efforts.By utilizing data, hotels can gain valuable insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and demand patterns. This information can be used to shape pricing tactics, promotional initiatives, and inventory control decisions.RateGain’s channel management solution provides comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities. Hoteliers can access key performance indicators (KPIs), occupancy rates, revenue insights, and booking trends to make data-driven decisions and identify areas for improvement.Hotels must try to maximize direct bookings.While third-party channels are important, hotels should also focus on maximizing direct bookings. Direct bookings provide greater control over the guest experience and reduce dependency on commissions paid to intermediaries. Hotels can incentivize direct bookings through loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and personalized experiences, building stronger guest relationships.Distribution challenges in the hospitality industry are complex, but with the right strategies and best practices, hotels can overcome them to enhance their distribution capabilities, improve profitability, increase revenue, and enhance the guest experience. Thus, driving a holistic business growth.Hoteliers must stay updated with industry trends, invest in technology solutions, and continuously evaluate and optimize their distribution strategies to remain competitive in the dynamic hospitality marketplace.Remember, technology is your friend when it comes to overcoming distribution challenges and achieving success in the ever-evolving hospitality industry.About the AuthorAlessandra Crifasi\n\nSenior Associate, Customer Success\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/solving-hotel-distribution-challenges-with-technology-and-strategy/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cracking-Distribution-Code-Navigating-Challenges-with-Technology-and-Strategy.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cracking-Distribution-Code-Navigating-Challenges-with-Technology-and-Strategy.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alessandra-Crifasi-150x150.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,Distribution,Revenue Management,thought leadership,,,,,0

This was followed shortly by American Airlines that introduced the AAdvantage program on May 1, 1981. These loyalty programs revolutionized the travel industry. Inspired by their success, hotel chains soon followed suit and began developing their own loyalty programs to attract and retain customers.1983: Marriott Hotels Launches Marriott Honored Guest AwardsOne of the earliest hotel loyalty programs was launched by Marriott Hotels in 1983. Known as the Marriott Honored Guest Awards, it allowed guests to earn points for their stays and redeem them for free nights or other rewards.

The program quickly gained popularity and became one of the most recognized and influential loyalty programs in the hotel industry.Over the years, hotel loyalty programs have evolved and expanded to meet the changing needs and expectations of travelers.Internet & Rapid Expansion of Hotel Loyalty ProgramsThe introduction of technology and the internet played a significant role in this evolution, allowing hotels to collect and analyze guest data more effectively, personalize offers, and streamline the redemption process.With the advancement of digital platforms and mobile applications, loyalty programs became more accessible and convenient for guests. Mobile apps provided members with the ability to track their rewards, make reservations, and access exclusive offers on the go.Loyalty Programs for Hotels & Allied PartnershipsHotel loyalty programs have also formed partnerships and alliances with other companies and industries, allowing members to earn and redeem rewards beyond hotel stays. By forming strategic alliances, hotel loyalty programs have expanded their reach and provided members with more opportunities to earn and redeem rewards beyond traditional hotel stays.These partnerships often include airlines, car rental companies, credit card companies, and retail brands, among others. For example, members may earn loyalty points for booking flights or renting cars through partner companies, or they can use their accumulated points to purchase merchandise, gift cards, or exclusive experiences.

These programs are designed to incentivize and reward customer loyalty, encouraging repeat business and fostering long-term relationships.

These tiers often include entry-level, elite, and premium tiers, each offering escalating benefits and perks. As guests move up the tiers by meeting specific criteria, they gain access to exclusive benefits such as room upgrades, late check-outs, dedicated customer service, and personalized experiences.Co-Branded Credit Card Programs for HotelsMany hotels collaborate with credit card companies to offer co-branded credit cards to their loyal customers. These credit cards enable cardholders to earn loyalty points or hotel rewards for their everyday purchases, not just hotel stays. Cardholders often receive additional benefits like accelerated point earning, elite status, or exclusive discounts, making the credit card a powerful tool for earning and redeeming rewards within the hotel loyalty program.Alliances and PartnershipsHotel loyalty programs have formed partnerships and alliances with other companies and industries to expand the scope of rewards. Through these collaborations, members can earn loyalty points for activities beyond hotel stays, such as booking flights, renting cars, dining at partner restaurants, or shopping with partner retailers. This broadens the range of opportunities for members to earn and redeem rewards, enhancing the overall value proposition of the loyalty program.Experience-Based Hotel Loyalty ProgramsSome hotel loyalty programs focus on providing unique and exclusive experiences to their members. These programs offer access to special events, behind-the-scenes tours, culinary experiences, spa treatments, or adventure activities that are not typically available to regular guests. By emphasizing experiential rewards, these programs aim to create memorable moments and foster deeper connections with their loyal customers.Overall, the hotel industry offers a range of loyalty programs, each with its own unique features and benefits.

In the hospitality industry, demand fluctuates throughout the year due to various factors such as weather, holidays, events, and travel patterns. Understanding and effectively managing the impact of seasonality on hotel revenue is essential for hoteliers to maximize revenue, optimize operations, and deliver exceptional guest experiences. Let us now explore the key aspects of seasonality and its profound effects on hotel revenue.Table of ContentsThe Nature of Seasonality in the Hotel IndustrySeasonality refers to the recurring patterns of high and low demand that hotels experience throughout the year. It is driven by both external factors, such as weather conditions and holidays, and internal factors, including marketing strategies and events hosted by the hotel. Recognizing the cyclical nature of seasonality is the first step towards developing effective revenue management strategies.Understanding Peak and Off-Peak SeasonsHotels commonly experience two types of seasons:While peak seasons present new revenue opportunities, off-peak seasons are characterized by the challenges they pose for the revenue managers.Revenue Opportunities in Peak SeasonsDuring peak seasons, hotels have the opportunity to maximize revenue through strategic pricing and yield management. By analyzing historical data, market trends, and booking patterns, hoteliers can adjust room rates dynamically to capitalize on high demand. Additionally, upselling and cross-selling techniques can be employed to enhance revenue by promoting additional services and amenities.Challenges and Strategies for Off-Peak SeasonsOff-peak seasons present challenges for hotels, as they often experience lower occupancy and reduced revenue. However, smart strategies can help minimize the impact of off-peak periods. This includes:Strategies to Mitigate the Impact of Seasonality on Hotel RevenueForecasting and Data AnalyticsAccurate forecasting and data analytics play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of seasonality.

65632758a3f6fc78b8eba11a,-1935279223,Walking the Tight Rope: High Hotel ADR and Low Distribution Cost,"June 7, 2023","Welcome to the world of hotel revenue management, where every penny counts. As hoteliers, we constantly strive to optimize our revenue and maximize our profitability. One crucial metric that plays a pivotal role in this pursuit is the Hotel ADR (Average Daily Rate). ADR is not just a number; it’s the heartbeat of your hotel’s financial success. Let us embark on a journey to unravel the secrets of ADR and explore how it can drive your hotel’s revenue to new heights. So, fasten your seatbelts, and let’s dive into the fascinating world of ADR!Table of ContentsHotel ADR: An IntroductionWhen it comes to understanding your hotel’s financial performance, ADR is a key indicator. It represents the average rate that guests pay per room, per night, excluding additional charges. Hotel ADR provides valuable insights into your hotel’s pricing strategy, market positioning, and overall revenue potential.ADR FormulaTo calculate ADR, divide the total room revenue generated by the number of rooms sold during a specific period. It provides a clear picture of how much revenue each occupied room is generating for your hotel on an average basis.Calculating Hotel ADRTo accurately calculate ADR, you need to have a robust system in place that captures all the relevant revenue and room night data. This includes revenue from different room types, add-on services, and promotions. By leveraging a comprehensive property management system (PMS) or revenue management software, you can streamline the data collection process and ensure accuracy in your ADR calculations.Relation between various Hotel Statistics: ADR, Occupancy Rate, RevPARADR = Occupancy Rate x RevPARHotel ADR and your Comp SetUnderstanding your competitive set (comp set) is vital for effective revenue management. Your comp set comprises hotels that are similar to yours in terms of location, amenities, and target market. By comparing your ADR with that of your comp set, you can gauge your hotel’s performance within the market. This analysis helps identify opportunities to increase the hotel ADR and remain competitive.Group ADRGroup bookings play a significant role in a hotel’s revenue strategy. Managing group ADR requires a strategic approach to balance the needs of group guests while maximizing revenue potential. Group ADR can be influenced by negotiation strategies, contract terms, and additional services offered. By carefully managing group rates and contracts, hotels can optimize revenue and maintain healthy ADR levels.Fade Rate and its Impact on ADRFade rate refers to the difference between the initial rate and the final rate for a specific period, typically seen in extended stay bookings. Understanding fade rates is essential for revenue management, as they can impact ADR calculations and revenue forecasting. By monitoring fade rates and implementing appropriate pricing strategies, hotels can effectively manage ADR fluctuations associated with extended stays.Causes and Concerns of Hotel ADR fluctuationsADR fluctuations are a common occurrence in the hospitality industry. Various factors can influence these fluctuations, including:While some fluctuations may be anticipated and manageable, sudden or prolonged drops in ADR can raise concerns about the hotel’s performance and market competitiveness. It is essential to monitor ADR trends closely and take proactive measures to address any negative impact on revenue.Setting ADR GoalsSetting realistic ADR goals is crucial for achieving optimal revenue performance. By analyzing historical data, market trends, and competitor benchmarks, you can establish target ADRs that align with your hotel’s positioning and revenue objectives. These goals should be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on market dynamics to ensure ongoing success.Revenue managers must do an Y-o-Y analysis of various data points including:Strategies to Increase Hotel ADRTo boost ADR and drive revenue growth, hotels can employ various strategies. These include:Implementing dynamic pricing strategies based on demand and market conditionsOne effective strategy to increase ADR is to implement dynamic pricing, where room rates are adjusted in real-time based on demand and market conditions.By leveraging data analytics and revenue management systems, hotels can optimize rates to maximize revenue. For example, during periods of high demand, such as holidays or major events, hotels can increase rates to capture the increased willingness to pay. Conversely, during low-demand periods, hotels can offer discounted rates to stimulate occupancy and generate revenue that would otherwise be lost.Upselling and cross-selling additional services and amenitiesAnother strategy to boost ADR is through upselling and cross-selling. By offering guests additional services and amenities beyond the basic room rate, hotels can increase the overall value of each booking. This can include upselling to higher room categories, offering add-on packages such as breakfast or spa services, or promoting upgrades for enhanced experiences. Effective training of staff and implementing personalized guest communication can help drive upsell and cross-sell opportunities, resulting in higher ADR and increased guest satisfaction.Creating attractive packages and promotionsCreating appealing packages and promotions can incentivize guests to book at higher rates. Hotels can design packages that include value-added services or experiences, such as spa treatments, complimentary meals, or local attractions. These packages can be marketed to specific target segments, such as couples, families, or business travelers, to cater to their unique preferences and increase their willingness to pay. By bundling services and experiences, hotels can differentiate themselves from competitors and command higher rates, ultimately driving ADR growth.Focusing on targeted marketing campaignsTargeted marketing campaigns play a crucial role in attracting high-value guests who are willing to pay higher rates. By understanding the preferences and behaviors of different guest segments, hotels can tailor their marketing messages and channels accordingly. This can include personalized email campaigns, social media advertising, and partnerships with travel agents or corporate clients. By effectively communicating the value proposition of the hotel and highlighting unique selling points, hotels can position themselves as the preferred choice, allowing for higher rates and increased ADR.Continuously monitoring and analyzing market trends, competitor rates, and guest feedbackTo optimize ADR, it is essential for hotels to stay informed about market trends, competitor rates, and guest feedback. By actively monitoring these factors, hotels can identify opportunities to adjust rates and offerings to stay competitive and capture demand. Analyzing market data and guest feedback can reveal insights into guest preferences, allowing hotels to make informed decisions regarding pricing and service enhancements. Regular analysis of competitor rates helps ensure that a hotel’s rates are in line with market expectations, while also identifying opportunities for rate positioning and differentiation.Tips for Hoteliers to Balance Online and Direct Bookings“Minimize costs, maximize revenues” — the quest is ubiquitous across all businesses. With no exceptions for the hotel industry.With the costs running high into labor, debt, franchise fees, utilities and real estate taxes, little can hoteliers do little to really ‘minimize’ the cost of operation. But an area does exist where the beast can be trapped – the distribution system.One of the main defies of hotels today is to reduce the costs going into distribution channels, thereby increasing RevPar (Revenue per available room) and ADR. But with a steady increase in inflation, the rise in customers’ expectations and harsh competition, balancing costs and ADR becomes difficult.Distribution cost; not just a one-time costFirst, we need to look at distribution cost from a different perspective; cost of distribution to online channels need not be considered as a one-time cost of publishing your inventory and getting bookings. Rather, the cost of distribution needs to be spread into short term and long term costs.Cost of distribution, may appear like an expensive affair for achieving bookings when compared to direct bookings. However, if we change our perception and start believing it to be an acquisition investment for procuring a customer, whom you may turn into a loyal repeat customer too, then this cost will automatically look apparently low.A holistic approach to occupancyAlthough it sounds intuitive, high occupancy is not always the breadwinner of high profit a.k.a. the bottom line. For instance, a hotel with 90% occupancy and no price reduction may earn more revenue than its competitor, who decided to charge 15-20% less than the former and achieved 100% occupancy. This is specifically a case for transient booking, however, when it comes to corporate/group bookings, business dynamics is absolutely different.In the era of dynamic pricing, forecasting occupancy is not always yielding accurate results. What hoteliers must forecast instead is the demand level and tune their pricing and revenue maximisation strategy to it.Hence, hotels must focus to maximize profitable bookings as well as booking volume.Prioritize direct bookings but don’t ignore the OTAsTo summarize, it is not just about trying to replace OTAs with the hotel’s own website. In fact, it is about utilizing OTAs for increasing occupancy and as initial guest acquisition cost and there after using these bookings to establish a more one to one and direct connect with your guests for building loyalty and referral business in future.Optimize your website for online bookings and strategize your digital marketing planTarget long-term customer relationshipsWe see the importance of tapping into new customer segments being religiously emphasized. However, devising ways to reach out to past guests helps build a better CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) for the hotel. It cuts the costs going into heavy research on new trends and markets and provides a benefit most hoteliers can immediately leverage because they already have access to their old guests’ data.The ‘price wars’ created with an incessant emphasis on dynamic pricing and competing with prices listed at OTAs make it difficult for hotels to communicate their brand value to the customer. In fact, dynamic pricing raises risks of brand devaluation due to consistent lowering of prices.To make their booking value-driven instead of price-driven, hoteliers must strive for direct interaction with their visitors through their own websites and other digital marketing tools. This gives hotels ample room to present themselves in the most marketable way to their website visitors. Better CLV engenders guest loyalty, which can offset the consequences of the price-cutting wars among hoteliers.What is it that should make the customer choose your hotel instead of an Airbnb accommodation that is available at less than half the price you offer? Hotels must focus on that element and integrate it in their value creation strategy.Educating the visitor about the property features and facilities through a personal website can also justify high booking prices for now the guest has several other aspects to consider and appreciate other than the price. Whether it is a 24/7 assistance or a friendly cancellation policy, the visitor knows it all from the hotel website. This type of value-driven promotion through direct channels will bring higher ADRs without compromising occupancy.Since distribution system is the one of the major areas of expenditure that a hotel can regulate, it is instructive that hoteliers cut costs there to maximize ADRs. Steps towards building guest loyalty, prioritizing profitable bookings along with maximizing occupancy and driving as much revenue from direct bookings as possible offer the greatest cost-cutting benefits.To draw a conclusion here; hotels should actively manage and optimize their OTA distribution to keep costs and profitability in balance and at the same time evolve their direct marketing to take advantage of lower overheads and better ways to develop direct relationships with guests.Adopting both of these techniques together will improve profitability as online and direct bookings go hand in hand and not in silos for maximizing a hotel’s revenue.

6563275fa3f6fc78b8eba124,1441029774,Data and Analytics Can Help You Distribute Your Hotel Inventory Effectively & Run Hotel Profitably,"May 26, 2023","The Internet has had an impact on almost every industry out there and how could hotel industry be an exception to this revolution. Traditional booking mechanisms like phones and agents have been replaced by OTAs, brand websites, and other channels. Some channels are more profitable or we can say less costly than others are. Hotels have to continuously make sure that they are using the most profitable channel to sell their inventory to maximize revenues. Yielding and Pricing strategy has the prime role to play in determining which channel shall be used to maximize revenues. However, some hotel revenue managers fail to determine which channels have been major contributors to the revenue against the cost incurred on them.Studies reveal that cost of distribution has grown manifold as compared to revenues. This scenario can be detrimental to the health of the hotel industry in the long run and calls for hoteliers to adopt measures to control distribution costs. Some channels even charge up to one-third of the room price as commissions.With so much to leave on the table, it becomes imperative for hotels to continually audit the performance and contribution of different channels to the revenue. Optimum hotel distribution not only affects financial health but also has a considerable impact on marketing strategies and technology required to maintain the sales data.Hospitality industry becomes fiercely competitive when it comes to urban properties like resorts and penthouses. They are generally booked by high spenders and hence award opportunities to hoteliers to earn handsome returns on such big size bookings. This also calls for hotels to determine the channels that not only fetch the best room rates but also clinch high-spending guests. Evaluating these drill-down parameters can only reveal the right distribution channel that is most profitable in the true sense.Various distribution channels ranging from call/walk-ins, Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) to diverse online channels like OTAs, metasearch sites, and social media have made the profitable hotel distribution task more intricate and complex than ever before. Successful hotel operation demands the all three parties responsible for distribution, marketing and revenue to work together in close coordination to optimize pricing strategy, revenue generation and net profits.Table of ContentsKey Problems in DistributionLet us discuss key problems that hoteliers face in distribution and how they can use real-time search monitoring to address these challenges?Inventory allocationsFiguring how many rooms to be sold through which channel and whenIn times of high demand, revenue managers have enough room to experiment with different channels and manage to get away with decent revenues. However, in times of low demand and excess capacity, choosing a wrong or costly channel mix can bleed already lean revenues. Hotels may end up giving high commissions to OTAs even with slashed prices making it difficult to recover operational costs.Opportunity: Real-time monitoring of search traffic through major distribution channelsRevenue management and distribution management are complementary to each other. They are committed to selling the right room, to the right customer and equally important, at the right time. This helps hotels earn maximum revenues from every channel. Hotels should monitor the performance of their distribution channels in real time so that they have a clear idea of hotel inventory availability enabling them to set the right prices on the right channel.Real-time data for keeping track of demandDemand estimation and changing prices in real timeHotel industry clearly thrives on dynamic pricing. Higher the demand, higher the prices and vice versa. Hotels need to have a clear idea of their demand patterns so that they can change the prices proactively and not leave a single buck of revenue on the table. Moreover, hotels need to be equally vigilant that their prices are reasonable and do not induce demand resistance among the target audience.Monitoring real-time search traffic for early warnings of high, low or abnormal demand flowsAs discussed earlier hotels should be aware of market demand under all circumstances. Usually, the rise in demand at various times in the year aligns with the historical demand patterns. However, sometimes, hotel demand rises uncertainly due to an upcoming big conference or any event in the city. Hotels should monitor search data to keep a tap on any impending rise in demand. This provides hoteliers to proactively change their pricing to earn the maximum revenues out of every opportunity.Negotiation strategies with OTAsIdentify OTAs that fetch the best guest, for the least commissionsUntil now, OTAs contribute a maximum number of bookings for any hotel. There are “n” number of OTAs in the market for hotels to choose from. Selecting the right OTAs for hotel distribution can do wonders. An OTA that can get maximum bookings for least commission are the ones to be chosen. Evaluating search traffic can bring out surface stats as to which OTAs attract a maximum number of visitors. This can help hotels to shortlist OTAs to choose from.These stats can help hotels negotiate the much painful commissions and establish grounds for reasonable demands by the OTAs. Not all OTAs work out well for any hotel and any hotel cannot rely on one OTA for all the bookings. Hotels need to tie up with different OTAs to assess which perform better and discard the ones that are less profitable.Customer segmentationIdentifying guest categoriesGuest is no less than Gods to hotels. They are the king and shall be dealt with appropriately. However, like fingers, not all guests are the same. They can be categorized on different parameters like age, motive of booking like leisure or businessHotel’s success depends much on their ability to deliver 1-to-1 personalized offers and services to each guest. However, there are many things a Revenue Manager can do to better understand the guests searching for a room, the context of the travel and the distribution channels being used. Insight about the purpose of the travel, such as leisure or business, families, singles or groups can be derived to offer more targeted offers.Use real-time search context to identify customer segment and improve offersWith changing business models, up front it is not easy to figure out which bookings are business bookings and which ones are purely leisure, in fact, these days it is a mix of both (Bleisure). However, considering mid-week bookings as business and weekend bookings as leisure bookings can help in some way. This lets hoteliers come up with suitable packages at the right time for right customer group, which fits in their budget thus increasing the number of bookings.Hotel distribution is an intricate and painstaking process exposed to a myriad of market forces. We can decode some of the governing forces and develop strategies around them to utilize them to our benefit.By above discussion, our readers can clearly establish how search-based analytics can help hotels optimize the hotel inventory distribution game.",https://rategain.com/blog/data-analytics-distribute-hotel-inventory-profitably/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hotel-Technology-3-Leveraging-Data-and-Analytics-to-Distribute-Your-Hotel-Inventory-Effectively.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hotel-Technology-3-Leveraging-Data-and-Analytics-to-Distribute-Your-Hotel-Inventory-Effectively.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,hotel technology,Inventory Management,Yield management,,,,,0

These channels can be online or offline and enable hotels to reach a wide audience, expand their market reach, and generate bookings.What is the Role of Distribution Channels in the Hospitality Industry?Distribution channels play a crucial role in the success of the hospitality industry, particularly in the hotel sector. These channels serve as the bridge between hotels and potential guests, facilitating the booking process and shaping the overall guest experience.Here’s how hotel distribution companies play a crucial role in expanding reach and maximize revenue with a vast network of travel agents and distribution partners.Enhancing VisibilityDistribution channels significantly contribute to a hotel’s visibility in the market. By partnering with various distribution channels such as online travel agencies (OTAs), global distribution systems (GDS), metasearch engines, and direct booking platforms, hotels can expand their reach to a wide range of potential guests.These channels provide extensive exposure, ensuring that hotels are visible to travelers across different demographics, geographies, and booking preferences. Increased visibility leads to greater brand awareness, attracting more guests and generating higher occupancy rates.Increasing RevenueEffective distribution channel management directly impacts a hotel’s revenue generation. By leveraging multiple distribution channels, hotels can tap into diverse customer segments and capture bookings that they might not have reached otherwise.Each distribution channel brings its own customer base and marketing capabilities, enabling hotels to maximize their revenue potential. Moreover, distribution channels often offer dynamic pricing options, allowing hotels to adjust rates based on market demand, competitor analysis, and seasonal trends. This flexibility helps hotels optimize revenue and occupancy rates, ensuring optimal financial performance.Improving Guest ExperienceDistribution channels play a vital role in shaping the overall guest experience. With the advent of online booking platforms, guests have become accustomed to the convenience of browsing, comparing, and booking hotels at their fingertips.Distribution channels provide seamless and user-friendly interfaces, making it easier for guests to find suitable accommodations, explore amenities, and make reservations. Moreover, distribution channels often feature guest reviews and ratings, allowing potential guests to make informed decisions based on the experiences shared by previous visitors. By delivering a positive and streamlined booking process, distribution channels contribute to a positive guest experience from the very beginning of their journey.Expanding Market ReachOne of the primary advantages of distribution channels is their ability to expand a hotel’s market reach. Through partnerships with OTAs and GDS platforms, hotels can tap into a vast network of travel agents and agencies. These channels provide access to a global audience of travel enthusiasts and corporate clients, enabling hotels to target different market segments and attract international visitors. Additionally, metasearch engines allow guests to compare prices and amenities across multiple platforms, helping hotels reach price-sensitive travelers and gain a competitive edge. By diversifying distribution channels, hotels can reach new markets and unlock untapped revenue streams.Read Why: Metasearch is critical for your Direct Bookings StrategyStrengthening Relationships with PartnersDistribution channels foster collaboration and partnerships within the hospitality industry. By working closely with OTAs, GDS providers, and other distribution partners, hotels can establish mutually beneficial relationships.These partnerships often involve joint marketing campaigns, targeted promotions, and preferred placement on distribution platforms. By cultivating strong alliances, hotels can leverage the marketing expertise and customer base of these partners, resulting in increased visibility and bookings.Revenue Optimization with Expert AdviceHotel distribution companies possess valuable expertise and insights into the hospitality industry. They can provide hotels with expert advice on revenue optimization strategies, pricing tactics, and market trends. These companies have access to data analytics tools that help identify patterns, booking trends, and demand fluctuations, enabling hotels to make informed decisions to maximize revenue.Through regular performance analysis and reporting, hotel distribution companies help hotels identify underperforming channels, adjust pricing strategies, and implement targeted marketing campaigns. With their in-depth knowledge of the industry, these companies offer guidance on positioning the hotel within the market, identifying unique selling points, and differentiating from competitors.By strategically selecting and managing distribution channels, hotels can effectively position themselves in the market, attract a diverse range of guests, and achieve long-term success.But to do so, we must understand the different types of online hotel distribution channels.Which are the Most Popular Types of Hotel Distribution Channels?Common hotel distribution channels include online travel agencies (OTAs), global distribution systems (GDS), direct bookings through the hotel’s website, metasearch engines, and wholesalers. By utilizing multiple distribution channels, hotels can increase their visibility and accessibility to potential guests.Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)OTAs such as Expedia, Booking.com, and Agoda are popular distribution channels that provide a platform for hotels to showcase their inventory to a global audience. They offer a wide range of accommodation options and allow travelers to compare prices and book rooms conveniently.Global Distribution Systems (GDS)GDS platforms like Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport serve as intermediaries between hotels and travel agents. They provide a centralized system for travel agents to access real-time information about hotel availability, rates, and bookings.Direct BookingsDirect bookings refer to reservations made directly through a hotel’s website or reservation system. This distribution channel enables hotels to establish a direct relationship with guests, offering benefits such as higher profit margins and the opportunity to provide personalized experiences.Metasearch EnginesMetasearch engines like Google Hotel Search, Trivago, and Kayak aggregate hotel information from various sources and allow users to compare prices and book directly through the platform. They provide a convenient way for travelers to find the best deals and make informed booking decisions.Read More: Metasearch Engines: A Game Changer for Online BusinessesWholesalersWholesalers purchase hotel inventory in bulk and distribute it to specific markets or travel segments. They often target niche markets and cater to specific customer needs, such as group travel or package deals.Read More: How to Benefit from Hotel WholesalersWhat are the Key Aspects of Effective Key Channel Management?Rate ParityRate parity refers to the consistency of rates across all distribution channels. It ensures that the same room is available at the same price, regardless of the booking platform. Maintaining rate parity is crucial for a hotel’s reputation and guest loyalty. By enforcing rate parity, hotels avoid rate discrepancies that could lead to customer confusion or dissatisfaction. Rate parity also fosters fair competition among distribution channels, preventing price undercutting and maintaining a level playing field for all partners.To achieve rate parity, hotels can implement automated channel management systems that synchronize rates and availability across all platforms in real-time. These systems help hotels maintain rate integrity, reduce manual errors, and ensure consistent pricing for guests.Inventory ManagementEffective inventory management is vital to avoid overbooking or underselling rooms. Hotels must allocate inventory across different distribution channels to maximize occupancy and revenue. By implementing a centralized inventory management system, hotels can have a real-time overview of their available rooms and distribute them strategically across channels.Inventory management systems also enable hotels to implement restrictions and control room allocations based on factors such as room type, rate plans, and booking window. This ensures that inventory is appropriately allocated to different channels, optimizing revenue while avoiding overbooking situations.Read More: How do Hotels Distribute Inventory to Drive BookingsChannel OptimizationOptimizing distribution channels involves selecting the most relevant and profitable channels for a hotel’s target audience. Hotels should evaluate the performance of each channel based on factors such as booking volume, revenue generated, and customer acquisition costs.

By staying informed about changing market dynamics, hotels can adapt their distribution strategy to maximize revenue and reach the right audience.Performance AnalysisRegular performance analysis is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of distribution channels and make data-driven decisions. Hotels should track key performance metrics such as conversion rates, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and return on investment (ROI) for each distribution channel.Analyzing performance metrics helps hotels identify underperforming channels, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies. By leveraging data analytics tools and reports, hotels can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, booking patterns, and channel performance, empowering them to optimize their distribution strategy.Streamlining OperationsEfficient distribution channel management goes beyond revenue optimization. It also involves streamlining operations and ensuring consistent branding across all channels. Hotels should maintain consistent and accurate information across all distribution platforms, including room descriptions, amenities, and images. Any updates or changes should be promptly reflected across all channels to avoid guest confusion and maintain brand integrity.Moreover, streamlining operations involves automating processes wherever possible. Utilizing channel management software, property management systems, and booking engines can help hotels automate inventory distribution, update rates, and availability in real-time, and seamlessly manage reservations.Embracing the Digital Era: Hotel Online Distribution StrategiesIn the digital age, hotels need to adapt to changing consumer behavior and leverage online distribution strategies to stay competitive. By adopting these strategies and leveraging technology, hotels can effectively navigate the online landscape and create a strong online presence.Responsive Website DesignIn the era of mobile devices and increasing online bookings, having a responsive website design is crucial for hotels. A responsive website ensures that your hotel’s website is optimized for different screen sizes and provides a seamless user experience across devices. With more travelers using smartphones and tablets to research and book accommodations, a responsive website design improves accessibility, engagement, and conversion rates. It also enhances your search engine rankings and boosts your online visibility, ultimately driving more direct bookings.Search Engine Optimization (SEO)To increase your hotel’s online visibility and attract more organic traffic, implementing effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies is essential. SEO involves optimizing your website’s content, structure, and metadata to rank higher in search engine results. By researching relevant keywords, optimizing page titles and descriptions, and creating high-quality, keyword-rich content, you can improve your hotel’s visibility on search engines like Google. This, in turn, drives targeted traffic to your website, increases brand exposure, and boosts direct bookings. Regularly monitoring and refining your SEO efforts will help you stay ahead of the competition and attract more guests through organic search.Social Media MarketingSocial media platforms have become powerful marketing tools for hotels. Creating a strong social media presence allows you to engage with potential guests, showcase your property’s unique features, and build brand loyalty. By crafting compelling content, sharing stunning visuals, and leveraging user-generated content, you can create a strong emotional connection with your target audience. Social media platforms also offer advertising options that enable you to target specific demographics and reach potential guests. Integrating social media marketing into your online distribution strategy can amplify your brand’s reach, increase engagement, and drive traffic to your website, ultimately leading to more direct bookings.Online Reputation ManagementIn the digital era, online reviews and guest feedback play a significant role in travelers’ decision-making process. Effective online reputation management involves actively monitoring and responding to guest reviews across various platforms. By promptly addressing guest concerns, expressing gratitude for positive feedback, and implementing guest feedback to improve your operations, you can enhance your hotel’s reputation and build trust with potential guests. Positive online reviews and a strong reputation contribute to increased bookings and word-of-mouth recommendations. Implementing reputation management tools and encouraging guests to leave reviews can help you proactively manage your online reputation and maintain a positive brand image.Technology for Streamlining Online DistributionAdvancements in technology have revolutionized hotel distribution channel management. By adopting the right technology solutions, hotels can automate processes, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive edge in the dynamic distribution landscape.How to Build a Hotel Distribution Channel StrategyBuilding a successful hotel distribution channel strategy involves several key steps.Best Practices for Maximizing Distribution Channel PerformanceIn the dynamic landscape of hotel distribution, maximizing the performance of distribution channels is crucial for hotels to stay competitive and drive revenue. By regularly auditing channels, managing pricing and rates strategically, optimizing content, proactively managing guest reviews, and staying abreast of industry trends, hotels can enhance their distribution channel performance and effectively reach their target audience.Regular Channel AuditsPerforming regular channel audits allows hoteliers to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of their distribution channels. By analyzing metrics such as bookings, revenue, conversion rates, and channel costs, hotels can identify any underperforming channels and make informed decisions to optimize their distribution mix. It’s essential to assess factors like channel reach, target audience alignment, and cost-effectiveness to ensure optimal channel selection and allocation of resources. Regular audits also help identify any technical issues or discrepancies that may impact the guest booking experience and can be addressed promptly.Pricing and Rate ManagementEffective pricing and rate management is vital for maximizing distribution channel performance. Hoteliers should adopt a dynamic pricing strategy based on market demand, seasonality, and competitor analysis. By leveraging revenue management systems and rate intelligence tools, hotels can set competitive rates that optimize revenue while considering channel-specific pricing rules. It’s crucial to monitor rate parity across distribution channels to maintain consistency and avoid rate disparities that may lead to guest dissatisfaction or loss of bookings. Regularly analyzing pricing data and adjusting rates based on demand fluctuations contribute to improved channel performance.Content OptimizationOptimizing content across distribution channels ensures consistency and provides compelling information that drives guest engagement and conversions. Hoteliers should focus on creating high-quality descriptions, captivating visuals, and accurate room information to entice potential guests. Tailoring content to suit the target audience of each channel enhances relevancy and attracts qualified leads. Additionally, optimizing keywords and metadata improves search engine visibility and increases the chances of appearing in relevant searches. Regularly updating content with fresh images, room descriptions, and promotional offers maintains the interest of potential guests and drives bookings.Guest Reviews ManagementManaging guest reviews is critical for maintaining a positive online reputation and driving bookings through distribution channels. Hoteliers should actively monitor and respond to guest reviews across platforms promptly. Responding to both positive and negative reviews demonstrates attentiveness and engagement with guests. Addressing concerns, expressing gratitude for positive feedback, and resolving issues in a timely manner can significantly influence potential guests’ perception and decision-making. Encouraging guests to leave reviews and leveraging guest feedback to improve services and operations showcases a commitment to guest satisfaction, enhancing the reputation and performance of distribution channels.Staying Updated with Industry TrendsThe hospitality industry is continuously evolving, driven by technological advancements and changing guest preferences.

With their ability to aggregate information from various sources, metasearch engines have revolutionized the way customers search and make purchasing decisions. Let us now delve into the world of metasearch engines, explore their significance, and understand why metasearch advertising has become an integral part of every business’s marketing strategy.Table of ContentsUnderstanding Metasearch EnginesMetasearch engines act as powerful platforms that gather information from multiple sources, including search engines, online travel agencies (OTAs), and individual hotel websites. They present users with comprehensive search results, displaying options and prices from various websites on a single page. This convenience makes metasearch engines increasingly popular among travelers and consumers looking for the best deals and options.What is Metasearch Advertising?Metasearch advertising refers to the practice of advertising on metasearch engines to increase visibility and drive direct bookings.

65632773a3f6fc78b8eba13e,-212198991,Where does Content Fit in the Evolution of Hotel Distribution?,"May 20, 2023","Hospitality has come a long way, with the travel and tourism industry generating around USD 5.81 trillion. The onset of the pandemic brought about quite a few colossal changes in their functionality and engagement, both in good and bad ways.In the last few years, hotel distribution has seen quite a few shifts, including the sudden increase in distribution channels, increased usage of metasearch sites, shift of focus on reducing distribution costs, the introduction of blockchain technology, and so on.However, most hotels are still having trouble keeping up with these adjustments to the system’s overall allocation. Most of these issues stem from hotels not understanding the essence of content in all this. Wait, what? Where does content fit into all this? And even if it does, content hasn’t done any good for me in the past. How is that going to change?You might be giving content much less credit than it deserves.Content is the crux of your overall hotel marketing strategy, and content is the primary driving force behind engagement and traffic generation. The further article breaks down the impact of content on the distribution mechanism and the upcoming changes you should be prepared for. If you wish to know more, read on!Table of ContentsWhat are the challenges faced in managing and distributing content?Hoteliers increasingly recognize the significance of modernizing their technological stack and online channels, with overall internet revenue for hotels having increased by 135%. However, the biggest challenge when it comes to managing and distributing content for a hotelier is realizing the importance of content in the first place. Hoteliers need to understand that content is much more dynamic than it seems.Read Why You Should Care About Hotel Content Management & DistributionHence, making a case for content takes the top spot regarding challenges hoteliers face in their marketing and distribution strategy. As a result, another challenge with this one is convincing the owners to invest more in content.Utilizing the channels hoteliers use is one of the best ways to mitigate this problem. By providing both static and dynamic content scores, these channels can encourage hotels to prioritize content creation.This gives the hoteliers something to react to, and channels can use this data to understand how hotels perceive content. The ultimate objective is to convince them that content is essential to your entire revenue and is far more real-time and dynamic for the client.Additionally, hoteliers also need feedback about their content from these intermediaries. A push to help boost their overall content score would automatically translate into higher engagement and sales. You will be astonished at the impact that even a 10% increase in content may have.To understand this, let’s consider an example. Travelport, a well-known GDS, recently conducted a content survey among its demand partners. The survey’s findings were clear, and content ranked first among the factors that aid the partners in raising their conversion ratios.As a result, the popular GDS then created a content ‘dress code’, which essentially gives partners a set of attributes or descriptive content that are deemed more valuable for their content marketing strategy and help in conversions.To keep them informed about the performance of their content, they also implemented static and dynamic scorecards that are updated monthly. The partners were able to significantly increase their content scores and traffic generation through constant communication.While we are on the subject, here are some other issues faced by hoteliers when it comes to managing and distributing content across various channels:What are the optimum channels for updating content?In an ideal world, hoteliers would typically survey and evaluate their conversion rates across various channels and OTAs. After a thorough examination and understanding of the type of content that impacts conversions, they will pay attention to the respective channels accordingly.However, in the practical world, they operate differently. RateGain recently conducted user interviews on this topic and found that most of their demand partners ask themselves one question: “Which externet is the most user-friendly?”Which OTA or channel allows them to log in efficiently and quickly update the content that they want to? Sorry to break it to you, but neither of these approaches will enable you to achieve the desired conversion rates.The key to successful content marketing is a uniform distribution across all channels. But how is that going to help? Well, to represent your brand consistently across all platforms, you must have consistent content.Naturally, as a hotelier, you will explore a variety of channels to decide conversion rates. Since there isn’t uniformity across all channels, this will lead to a disparity of content across them. There is a chance you might miss out on updating certain channels since they aren’t rated very highly. Hence, what you need is a platform that collates all the content, scores it, informs you on improvements, and pushes it uniformly across all platforms.To address this, RateGain recently developed an AI-powered content recommendation system. The platform offers a scoring engine that not only provides you with your content score but also teaches you how to raise it, allowing you to update all of your content parameters on a single screen.The article has been written based on the insights gathered from industry leaders.Watch the Complete Video on Content Management for Hotel DistributionMeet the Speakers",https://rategain.com/blog/content-management-for-hotel-distribution/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Adapting-Hotel-Distribution-Mastering-Content-Management-for-Success.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Adapting-Hotel-Distribution-Mastering-Content-Management-for-Success.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/April-300x300.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Krista-300x300.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/James-300x300.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Hotel Content Management,,,,,,,0

This is where a Hotel Content Management System (CMS) comes into play.Before we explore why a hotelier should care about using a Hotel CMS and the benefits it brings to their business, let us talk understand what a Hotel Content Management System is.Table of ContentsWhat is a Hotel Content Management System?A hotel content management system (CMS) is a software solution specifically designed to facilitate the creation, editing, organization, and publishing of digital content on a hotel’s website. It provides hoteliers with a user-friendly interface that allows them to manage their website’s content without the need for technical expertise or coding knowledge.What is the role of Hotel CMS?A hotel CMS empowers hoteliers to have full control over their website’s content, ensuring that it is up-to-date, accurate, and engaging for potential guests. It provides a centralized platform where hoteliers can create and update pages, upload images and videos, manage menus and navigation, and customize the design and layout of their website.With a hotel CMS, hoteliers can easily add new content, such as hotel descriptions, room types, amenities, dining options, local attractions, and promotional offers. They can also create landing pages for specific campaigns or events, publish blog articles, and manage guest reviews and testimonials.The primary goal of a hotel CMS is to streamline the content management process, allowing hoteliers to efficiently maintain their website and provide a seamless user experience for website visitors. It eliminates the need for manual coding or reliance on external web developers, enabling hoteliers to make real-time updates and changes to their website without any technical barriers.Additionally, a hotel CMS often integrates with other hotel systems such as booking engines, property management systems (PMS), channel managers, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools. This integration ensures that information is synchronized across different platforms, reducing manual data entry and improving operational efficiency.What is the Difference between a Hotel Content Management System and a Hotel Booking EngineWhile a hotel content management system (CMS) and a hotel booking engine are both essential tools for managing a hotel’s online presence, they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities. Understanding the differences between these two systems is crucial for hoteliers to effectively leverage their capabilities and optimize their online bookings.Hotel Content Management System (CMS)A hotel CMS is primarily focused on managing and organizing the content of a hotel’s website. It provides hoteliers with a user-friendly interface to create, edit, and publish digital content such as hotel descriptions, room details, amenities, photos, videos, blog articles, and more. The CMS allows hoteliers to customize the design, layout, and navigation of their website, ensuring that it is visually appealing, informative, and up-to-date. The CMS is responsible for content management, but it does not handle the actual booking process.Hotel Booking EngineA hotel booking engine, on the other hand, is a software application that enables guests to make direct online reservations on the hotel’s website. It integrates with the hotel’s property management system (PMS) and other distribution channels to provide real-time availability, rates, and inventory information to potential guests. The booking engine allows guests to search for available rooms, select their preferred dates, view pricing details, and complete the reservation process by securely entering their payment information. It streamlines the booking process, minimizes manual data entry, and provides instant confirmation to guests.The Relationship between a Hotel CMS and a Hotel Booking EngineWhile a hotel CMS and a hotel booking engine serve different purposes, they are closely related and often work together to provide a seamless user experience and maximize online bookings. Here’s how they are connected:Integrating a Content Management System with a Booking EngineOne significant benefit of using a Hotel Content Management System (CMS) is its ability to integrate seamlessly with a booking engine. The integration between a CMS and a booking engine allows hoteliers to provide a smooth and efficient online booking experience for their guests. Here’s a closer look at the importance and advantages of this integration:In conclusion, integrating a CMS with a booking engine brings numerous advantages to hoteliers. It streamlines the booking process, ensures real-time availability and rates, increases conversion rates, enables personalization and upselling, facilitates seamless guest communication, and provides valuable data for analysis and decision-making. By harnessing the power of this integration, hoteliers can optimize their online booking experience, drive revenue growth, and deliver exceptional service to their guests.Why Should a Hotelier Care About Using A Hotel Content Management SystemNow that we understand what a CMS means, let us now explore why a hotelier should care about using a Hotel CMS.Centralized Content ManagementA Hotel CMS allows hoteliers to centrally manage their content, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia assets, from one platform. This centralized approach ensures consistency and accuracy in the content displayed across various distribution channels, including the hotel’s website, online travel agencies (OTAs), and social media platforms. Hoteliers can easily update and distribute content in real-time, saving time and effort while ensuring that their online presence remains up to date.Streamlined DistributionWith a Hotel CMS, hoteliers can efficiently distribute their content to multiple channels with ease. Instead of manually uploading and updating content on each individual platform, a CMS enables hoteliers to distribute content seamlessly to their website, OTAs, global distribution systems (GDS), and other relevant channels. This streamlines the content distribution process, eliminates the risk of inconsistencies, and ensures that potential guests receive accurate and up-to-date information regardless of the platform they use.Enhanced Brand ConsistencyConsistent branding is essential for building a strong and recognizable hotel brand. A Hotel CMS enables hoteliers to maintain consistent branding across all online channels. They can easily incorporate their brand elements, such as logos, colors, fonts, and style guidelines, into their content. This consistency in branding helps create a cohesive and professional image, reinforces brand identity, and fosters guest trust and loyalty.Improved Content QualityA Hotel CMS empowers hoteliers to ensure the quality of their content by providing tools for content creation, editing, and optimization. They can create compelling descriptions, showcase high-quality images, and even embed videos to engage potential guests effectively. Moreover, CMS features like content validation and review workflows help maintain content quality standards, preventing inaccuracies or outdated information from being published.SEO OptimizationSearch engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for hotels to improve their visibility in search engine results and attract organic traffic to their website. A Hotel CMS often includes SEO-friendly features and tools that enable hoteliers to optimize their content for search engines. They can add relevant keywords, meta tags, and descriptions, as well as optimize their website’s structure and URLs. This SEO optimization helps increase the hotel’s online visibility, drive targeted traffic, and ultimately boost bookings.Time and Cost SavingsUtilizing a Hotel CMS can result in significant time and cost savings for hoteliers. With streamlined content management and distribution processes, hoteliers can efficiently update their content across multiple platforms without the need for manual entry or coordination with various providers. This saves valuable time and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, a CMS eliminates the need for extensive IT support or web development expertise, allowing hoteliers to manage their content independently and minimize associated costs.Flexibility and ScalabilityA Hotel CMS offers flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for hotels of all sizes and types. Whether it’s a small boutique hotel or a large chain, a CMS can adapt to varying needs and accommodate future growth. Hoteliers can easily add new features, integrate with other systems (e.g., property management systems or channel managers), and expand their content management capabilities as their business evolves.In conclusion, using a Hotel Content Management System is essential for hoteliers who strive to enhance their online presence, streamline content management, and deliver a consistent and engaging brand experience. By leveraging a Hotel CMS effectively, hoteliers can strengthen their digital presence, attract more guests, and ultimately drive revenue growth in today’s competitive hospitality landscape.How to Choose the Best CMS for your Hotel WebsiteSelecting the right Content Management System (CMS) is crucial for hoteliers looking to create a dynamic and engaging website that effectively showcases their property and attracts potential guests.

65632777a3f6fc78b8eba144,-759576359,Dynamic Pricing Strategy in Hotels for Hospitality Industry,"May 18, 2023","Dynamic pricing — Airlines practice it. So do online retailers and sports event organizers. Should hotels be an exception, then? Also known as time-based pricing, dynamic pricing strategy is a revenue-management strategy employed by various industries, involving real-time tweaking of prices of products or services on the basis of their demand and supply.Table of ContentsDynamic pricing in the hotel IndustryThanks to sophisticated technology and the internet, the pricing operations of hotels have never been more efficient and profitable. Hotels now have much headroom to experiment with revenue management approaches. We now witness their drift from the old fixed pricing approach, wherein the prices of every factor of booking, right from the rate of room to the length of stay would be categorically fixed and the only variable factor would be the number of rooms allotted to each category.Now, RMs can do quite the opposite. Through regular checks on demand and availability of rooms, the prices can be changed immediately to maximize sales and earn more profits every day.At low demand levels, low rates can aid in attracting guests and as the demand increases, so can the prices. Of course, customer segments would still be categorized on the basis of their preferences, types of rooms and time of arrival. But the prices for each category will be dictated by the forces of supply and demand. And, pricing managers can do all this with just a mouse-click and a revenue management system in place!A GBTA Survey on 200 travel managers revealed that 22 percent of them had started using the dynamic pricing method and were already leveraging it with at least one hotel company. This betokens a positive reception of the new approach by the industry.Revenue managers described the below-mentioned benefits of dynamic pricing, using the pricing structure:(Source: GBTA)How does dynamic pricing work?Hotels can start the day with a pre-determined forecast of bookings till a specific time of day, say afternoon. If the number of bookings exceeds or meets the estimate by that time, new and increased prices can be quoted for the next bookings owing to the observed demand surge. On the flip side, lower prices can be quoted if the bookings fail to match the forecast.Understanding Dynamic Pricing Strategy in HotelsTake an example to understand the concept of dynamic pricing further;<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3089"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dsfds.png"" alt=""Stats"" width=""357"" height=""180"" />Consider the case of the above-shared table of two scenarios A and B; the hotel has two-tiered pricing in scenario A with a group rate of $90 and a transient rate of $130. In scenario B, the hotel has a multi-tiered pricing: a low-demand rate of $90 and other rates of $110, $130, and $150, offered at increasing occupancy levels.Scenario B produced $2,600 more in revenue, witnessed an ADR increase of $10.40, and a RevPAR upsurge of $8.67.Note that in scenario B, the revenue manager closed the $90 rate after 80 rooms were booked and set the rate $110. After 60 more rooms were booked, this rate was closed and the next 60 rooms were booked for $130. When the next 60 units were booked and the hotel had 200 rooms booked, a rate of $150 was offered for the last 50 bookings.This approach increased room revenue, ADR, and RevPar by 9.8 percent without selling more unitsBut, that is not where it ends.Instead of adopting the common, “low to high” approach described above, the “high to low” approach can be used wherein a hotel quotes high prices at the start of the day and lowers the prices later if the demand fails to materialize.Consider this scenario to understand this concept;Consider a case where a revenue manager has forecasted a 75 percent occupancy for the day, only to realize that the day opens looking at only 60 percent ROB (rooms on the book) with a $150 BAR.Assuming that the missing 10 percent occupancy can be realized from walk-ins and same-day bookers, but by early afternoon, there is no demonstrated new demand for the posted rate. Late afternoon, the revenue manager decides to mediate and lowers the BAR to $139. And booking starts coming in; by 6 P.M., the hotel has picked up enough same-day bookings to expect 80 percent occupancy.Next, by shopping the comp set, the RM learns that some of the other competitor hotels are starting to sell out of certain room types. The revenue manager at this point decides to change tactic again. At 6:15 P.M., the RM closes down the discounted rate and posts a new rate for walk-ins of $180.Such is the power of dynamic pricing in the hotel business.Another way to ensure consistent profit maximization is to go the ‘U’ way. Hotels can keep a limited time window for which low booking prices would be offered, say, within 30 days from the booking date. Prior to this time window, high prices would be quoted. As the demand would increase within the 30-days-window, increased rates can be declared.What is in it for hotels?Points to considerWhile continuous price-tweaking may always seem like a win-win situation, the possible perils merit attention.Then, should a given hotel compete on price? That is a strategic decision to make. If a revenue manager makes a measured decision to use pricing as a competitive weapon, dynamic pricing can become one of the most effective tools in the combat for price-sensitive customers.Hence, caution must be practiced while carrying out pricing operations in a highly competitive market. Demand forecasts should be made by thoroughly studying aspects such as arrivals, reservations, conversions, cancellations, group bookings, no shows, seasonality and customer loyalty.Pricing intelligence software tools are most needed now, to compare prices, track inventory, to give hotels the market information they need and aid their pricing decisions and distribution while they stay competitive and kicking!",https://rategain.com/blog/what-dynamic-pricing-can-do-to-your-hotel-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy-for-the-Hospitality-Industry.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy-for-the-Hospitality-Industry.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dsfds.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Blog,,,Dynamic pricing,hotel pricing strategies,Rate shopping,Revenue maximization,,,,0

It involves considering various factors such as market demand, competition, seasonality, guest behavior, and operational costs.What is the Role of Hotel Pricing Strategies?The pricing strategy plays a crucial role in the success of a hotel as it directly impacts revenue generation, occupancy rates, and overall financial performance. It is important because an effective pricing strategy helps hotels achieve the delicate balance between attracting guests with competitive rates and maximizing profitability.

A well-executed pricing strategy enables hotels to effectively manage revenue, increase occupancy, and enhance overall financial performance in a highly competitive industry.What is Variable Hotel Pricing?Variable pricing involves adjusting hotel rates based on various factors such as demand, seasonality, and market conditions. By implementing variable pricing, hotels can optimize revenue by charging higher rates during high-demand periods and offering discounts during low-demand periods. This strategy helps hotels maximize revenue potential and achieve higher occupancy rates. Hoteliers can analyze historical booking data, market trends, and competitor rates to determine the optimal pricing for different periods and customer segments.What is Dynamic Pricing for Hotels?Dynamic pricing refers to the practice of adjusting prices in real-time based on demand fluctuations, market conditions, and other factors.

Advanced revenue management systems and market intelligence tools enable hotels to automate the dynamic pricing process, considering factors like competitor rates, booking patterns, and market demand. By leveraging dynamic pricing, hotels can capture the most value from each booking opportunity and maintain a competitive edge.What do you mean by Occupancy-Based Yield Management?Occupancy-based yield management involves adjusting prices based on forecasted occupancy levels and demand patterns. The goal is to optimize revenue by maximizing occupancy without sacrificing average daily rate (ADR). Hotels analyze historical data, booking patterns, and future demand forecasts to determine the optimal pricing strategy. During periods of high demand, hotels can increase rates to capture additional revenue, while during low-demand periods, they may offer discounts to stimulate bookings and avoid empty rooms. Occupancy-based yield management enables hotels to balance occupancy and revenue, resulting in optimal financial performance.What are the various Hotel Pricing Strategies?Occupancy-based pricingThis strategy involves adjusting prices based on occupancy levels, allowing hotels to optimize revenue during different occupancy scenarios.Segment-based pricingTailoring pricing strategies to different customer segments, such as corporate travelers, leisure guests, or groups, to meet specific needs and maximize revenue potential.Length-of-stay pricingOffering discounted rates for longer stays to encourage guests to book extended periods, increasing occupancy and overall revenue.Day-of-week pricingAdjusting rates based on the day of the week to account for variations in demand patterns, such as higher rates on weekends or lower rates on weekdays.Cancellation policy pricingImplementing flexible cancellation policies with different rates, allowing guests to choose options that suit their needs while protecting hotel revenue.Forecast-based pricingUsing data analysis and demand forecasting to set rates in advance, ensuring optimal pricing strategies are in place for anticipated demand fluctuations.Competitor-based pricingMonitoring competitor rates and adjusting prices to remain competitive while considering factors such as location, amenities, and market positioning.Demand-based pricingSetting rates based on demand levels and market conditions, such as increasing rates during peak periods or high-demand events.Penetration pricingOffering initially low rates to penetrate a new market or attract new customers, with the potential to adjust rates as the business grows.Rate parity pricingEnsuring consistent rates across all distribution channels to maintain price integrity, avoid rate disparities, and provide a fair playing field for all partners.Read More: 8 Easy Tips for Hotel Revenue Managers to Cope With Rate Parity IssuesDiscounts and promotionsOffering special discounts, packages, or promotional rates to incentivize bookings, attract new guests, and increase occupancy during specific periods.Loyalty-based pricingImplementing loyalty-based pricing to reward and incentivize loyal customers with exclusive rates, discounts, or personalized offers, fostering customer loyalty and repeat bookings.UpsellingOffering additional products, services, or room upgrades at a higher price point to enhance the guest experience and generate additional revenue.Cross-sellingRecommending and bundling complementary products or services, such as spa treatments, restaurant reservations, or local experiences, to increase revenue per guest.PackagingCreating bundled packages that combine accommodation with additional amenities or services at an attractive price, appealing to specific customer segments and driving revenue.Booking window pricingAdjusting rates based on the lead time between booking and arrival, encouraging early bookings with discounted rates or increasing rates for last-minute bookings.Why is it Important to Test & Experiment Pricing Strategies in the Hospitality Industry?Testing and experimenting with different pricing strategies is crucial for hotels to optimize their revenue and achieve higher occupancy rates.

6563277ba3f6fc78b8eba14a,-1852607636,Boost Your Hotel Revenue with Efficient Hotel Inventory Management,"May 16, 2023","As revenue consultants, we have experience from lots of hotels. Many of them have already grasped the reality of demand-driven daily pricing based on multiple factors.However, where room pricing management has become more flexible, availability management has not. In spite of the fluid nature of demand where segmentation has lost a lot of its past emphasis, hotels still insist on treating their inventory as a compartmentalised box with little room to play.Thus, no sooner than a base room type is sold out on the PMS level, it gets closed on all online channels. State-of-the-art tools like PMS-Channel Manager integration or common inventory pool within a channel manager for all online channels make this process ever faster and efficient.Yet when this happens for a given date, it means the hotel is not available on online channels anymore, or only offer other, more expensive room types, say, deluxe rooms.\n\nAs no OTAs can combine multiple room types within a hotel for longer stays and only lists hotels in search results when they offer continuous availability for the whole length of requested stay, this mostly means that even if you sell out and close out your base room type for just one single day over a period of two weeks, you hotel will not be in the search results of a customer looking for, say, a 10-night stay going through this one single closed-out date.Additionally, do not bet too much on this customer booking your superior room category, for two reasons. First, the Deluxe rooms are more expensive, i.e. less competitive and, second, superior room categories tend to be more scarce than the base room category, so they most likely won’t be available for the whole 10-night stay either.Which in turn means this high-value booking will go to your competitor.This can be taken care of easily. Just keep your base room category open at all times and never close. Be more flexible and work with your rates instead. If you sell out your base room category, just make it all more expensive and do not close.It does not matter if you sell your deluxe room for 175 EUR (as per your normal rates) or your standard room for 275 EUR (in case of yielding). If this indeed happens, you will be happy to upgrade the standard room reservation into the deluxe room if you happen to have no standard rooms at your hands at the moment.In addition, more importantly, you will not miss on the highest-value long-stay bookings. Moreover, there is also a bonus. Try to search for a 10-night stay on any busy online market and see how many results you get. Very few. Which is all making it much more likely for these valuable bookings to end up in your hotel.Moreover, if you factor-in cancellation rate in your calculations, you will get a very interesting game where you stand to much profit.\n\nThe demand in the global online marketplace has become fluid, so make your hotel inventory management a perfect fit.\n\nGood luck!Guest Contribution",https://rategain.com/blog/boost-hotel-revenue-inventory-availability-management/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Inventory-Management-4-Boost-your-Hotel-Revenue-with-Efficient-Hotel-Inventory-Management.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Inventory-Management-4-Boost-your-Hotel-Revenue-with-Efficient-Hotel-Inventory-Management.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/peterSalda-150x150-1.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,Inventory Management,Revenue Management,,,,0
6563277ca3f6fc78b8eba14c,2076398177,Cracking the Code: How to Benefit from Hotel Wholesalers,"May 16, 2023","Hotel room wholesalers act as intermediaries between travel suppliers (hotels) and travel agents, providing a vital role in the distribution of hotel rooms and rates. Their primary function is to purchase products (rooms, rates, and packages) in bulk from hotels and sell them to various clients (travel agents, OTAs, and tour operators), who then offer them to their customers (guests).Wholesalers, such as AOTGroup, CN Travel, FollowMe2Africa, Helloworld Travel, Abreu Online are just a few examples of the hundreds of wholesalers available for hotels to work with. Each wholesaler has a unique pricing structure and different selling methods. Some specialize in selling rooms only, while others offer packages, and some are limited to specific property types or markets.Working with wholesalers can have both advantages and disadvantages for hotels. On the one hand, wholesalers can provide access to a wider range of potential guests and help to fill rooms during low occupancy periods. On the other hand, they may charge high commission rates and can potentially undermine a hotel’s brand and pricing strategy. To manage relationships with wholesalers effectively, hotels should carefully consider which wholesalers to work with and negotiate favorable terms. It’s also important to monitor inventory closely and ensure that wholesalers are not undercutting direct hotel pricing.Technology can also be useful in managing relationships with wholesalers. Many cloud platforms can help hotels connect with wholesalers and manage inventory and pricing in real-time. However, it’s essential to carefully evaluate the cost-benefit of using technology and ensure that any investment in technology will ultimately benefit the hotel’s bottom line. Table of ContentsBenefits of Partnering with Wholesale Travel SuppliersDiverse Guest PoolPartnering with wholesale travel suppliers can offer access to a more diverse and unique range of guests. A well-rounded hotel distribution strategy should consist of a mix of direct and third-party bookings, providing various potential revenue streams.Higher ReachWholesale travel suppliers can offer a powerful level of reach, attracting international travelers and promoting hotels to online travel agents and retail agents, maximizing the exposure of the property.Access to New MarketsWholesale travel suppliers specialize in providing access to markets that hotels may not be able to reach on their own, making it a cost-effective form of marketing for the property.Better Occupancy Forecasting & Inventory ManagementWhen hotels have a contract with a wholesaler, they can more accurately forecast occupancy patterns, ensuring a specific volume of business and payment in advance. This can assist hotels in better managing their inventory and pricing strategy.While partnering with accommodation wholesalers can offer advantages, there are also several disadvantages that should be considered.Disadvantages of Working with Accommodation WholesalersReduced Commissions & Profit MarginsThe hotel industry has seen a rise in polarization due to wholesalers. Before the internet, wholesalers would purchase inventory and sell it to travel agencies, who would then sell it to customers.However, with the internet, inventory is now sold to online travel agents (OTAs) and other wholesalers, which can drive down hotel profit margin. In addition, this can lead to guests purchasing rooms from unknown OTAs, which can be frustrating for property and revenue managers.Undercutting Rates by OTAsFurthermore, there is a debate between contracted and non-contracted OTAs, with non-contracted OTAs being more aggressive in undercutting rates. On average, contracted OTAs post rates 5-6% lower than the direct rate, whereas non-contracted OTAs advertise rates 10-11% lower for lead times under and above 14 days. Need for Post-Sales ControlAdditionally, wholesalers need more control over what happens once the product has been sold, which can cause added complexity and impact hotel rate parity. As a result, many hotels are placing a greater emphasis on direct bookings rather than relying on wholesale distribution methods. Overall, while working with wholesalers can provide benefits, hotels must weigh the potential risks and challenges that come with this distribution channel. How to Manage Wholesale Agreements for your HotelManaging wholesale agreements can be challenging for hotels, especially with the complexities of the modern distribution landscape. However, severing ties with wholesalers altogether is only sometimes the best option, as they can still significantly benefit your hotel’s occupancy and revenue. Here are some best practices for managing your wholesale agreements effectively:Plan, Research, and TrialBefore entering into any agreement, you must have a clear plan and research the potential partners. Undertaking a trial period can help you determine if a long-term relationship with the wholesaler will be beneficial.Manage ConstantlyTreat wholesalers as true distribution partners and manage the agreement continuously. This will help avoid any parity violations and maintain control over your inventory and pricing.Analyze RegularlyKeep track of contract violations to decide if changes are needed to your agreements or if you want to continue the relationship.Seek Similar MindsLook for partners whose philosophy aligns with yours, as it can lead to a more mutually beneficial relationship.Be ProactiveUtilize dynamic rate agreements to reduce disparity and maintain control over pricing across all distribution channels.Track the Growth of APIsWhile APIs can be beneficial, be aware of who is accessing your inventory and at what price to maintain visibility and control.It’s essential to have dedicated resources to manage wholesale agreements effectively. However, if that’s not possible, seek information and learn from peers in the industry. Collaboration and smart partnerships can overcome challenges in the hotel industry, and hotels can benefit from sharing experiences and knowledge.Technology that will Help you Navigate Travel WholesalersHotel Channel ManagerTo simplify and improve the profitability of your hotel’s distribution, the industry’s go-to solution is a channel manager. This cloud-based tool enables you to centralize and easily manage all your distribution channels, with two-way data sharing and automatic updates between your property management system (PMS) and connected channels, including your website booking engine.As the number of channels grows, the need for a channel manager increases to enable instant rate adjustments, prevent double bookings, and expand your reach and potential revenue.Cloud platforms for hotels automate inventory and rate updates from wholesalers to your PMS, ensuring everything remains synchronized and eliminating manual entry. Additionally, a good channel manager can offer deep performance insights and integration with other business applications.Read More: What is a Hotel Channel Manager?

6563277ea3f6fc78b8eba14e,-2108050164,8 Easy Tips for Hotel Revenue Managers to Cope With Rate Parity Issues,"May 15, 2023","While rate parity ensures that you have complete control of setting the bar for your room rates and ensure equal prices across all distribution channels, it destroys your chances to compete freely in the market and also makes you lose a voluminous amount of potential revenue as massive commissions to the OTAs. Hotel revenue managers face challenges with rate parity issues, which restrict their pricing freedom and lead to potential revenue loss.The hospitality industry has mixed reaction against rate parity with OTAs and hotels having a different take on it. Countries including the USA, France, Italy, and Germany have already started employing measures to either restrict rate parity to specific scenarios, or completely do away with it.However, a deeper understanding of these changes will help you figure out how you can stay ahead of your competitors despite the developments that apparently inhibit your property’s potential to profit and grow. Let us delve into some tips to help you dash over the speed-breakers in your revenue-maximizing journey and build the right rate parity strategy.Table of ContentsPrepare yourself for a world without rate parityIn an ideal world, we can expect everyone to be fair and follow rate parity agreements. However, we do not live in such a world and thus the Rate Parity breach and the entire cycle of tracking who cut our rates, etc.OTAs bring you lots of revenue, but they come with just as many restrictions and rigid, unbending parity rules. A removal of such rules will make your revenue management and maximizing strategy much more flexible and provide you with ample room to experiment. Hence, you will no longer need to monitor what rates your partners and OTAs offer at a given time. You can compete in a market open to rapid price changes that can be dictated by the forces of demand and supply and not some agreements that may not be favourable for all times.Improve your hotel brand websiteThere is a reason why OTAs are so popular, the first choice for booking by travelers and they dominate as a primary source of the vast majority of online bookings. This is because apart from marketing efforts, they have also invested in an appealing user interface to build a brand identity and brand image. They have ensured to provide the customers with an efficient user experience that involves fast web page loading, regular updates, call-to-action buttons that are easy to locate and a robust online booking engine.If you invest in a website that has all the aforementioned ingredients, you have a recipe for a revenue-maximizing machine and direct bookings. You can then use your website to drive in a stream of regular direct bookings and spent less in the commissions you would otherwise pay out to OTAs, which would go up to as high as 20% or more! Not only do you get more revenue, but you also get the opportunity to familiarize the visitor with your brand and other useful information such as offers, packages and discounts, that they may seek.OTAs are your friends in needEven though OTAs demands for commissions can often be sky high, they are a powerful medium for not just revenue generation, but also brand promotion. You can use the power of ratings and reviews to rank your hotel’s listing higher up in your preferred OTAs database, which will help you drive in traffic and guests, especially, during the off-season. Given the popularity of OTAs, it is unwise to rely solely on direct website bookings to generate revenue, as the likelihood of higher direct bookings during the low season would seem abysmal. OTA listings can still help your hotel shine through in those tough times.Prioritize balance in online distributionWe have discussed that hotels cannot do without OTAs. However, a pertinent question you need to answer is — how many of them do you need? Conventional wisdom might make one assume, higher the number of distribution channels, higher will the risk distribution be. However, in the absence of rate parity, managing dramatic price fluctuations will be a needless hassle. Hence, in today’s scenario, it is instructive to focus on only the distribution channels that perform well and give you more profitable bookings. Practice Yield Management, which means that the most cost-effective and revenue-generating channels will make the cut.Go direct with travelersWhat is the most cost-effective way to obtain a booking? We all know, bookings made directly from your hotel’s website are most profitable, as they are commission free! Encourage your guests to book rooms directly from your own online booking tool. Simple incentives such as free pick and drops, free Wi-Fi, etc. or non-room service bonuses on direct bookings can go a long way in developing a steady stream of direct, commission-free revenue. The best part about it is that you can employ this technique even when your hotel’s OTA listing is what brings the customer to your website. We know that comparing rates across different booking media is common among online guests.Leverage the magic of loyalty programs and close user group membershipsA great way to maximize direct bookings and sustain commission free revenue is to build long-term customer relationships. This requires you to identify your frequent visitors and actively engage them in loyalty programs or close user group (CUG) membership schemes. Once they have booked with you directly, ensure to make their stay a memorable one for them to stay loyal to you. Hotels like IHG and Accor hook their prospect guests on Metasearch/OTA sites itself, by offering them to become their privileged members and avail instant discounts on the booking rates.Gather all details regarding their preferences, as this information will help you to design custom offers for different guest profiles and price them accordingly, thereby nourishing them to the fullest of your potential.Apart from their booking behaviour, you can also look at their inclinations for non-room services, an area that OTAs have no information or control. Including services such as spa, gym, bars and such like into your guests’ custom plans, based on their liking, not only helps you deliver quality service, but also conveys your genuine care for them.Look out for distribution alternativesEven though OTAs largely dominate the hotel bookings arena, alternatives have started to pop up. For example, Google has now enabled online hotel bookings through its own listings. This may come as a massive respite for those hoteliers who had long been searching for a cost-effective distribution channel than OTAs. Keeping an eye on such trends can be beneficial as now and then, you may come across a channel that meets all your revenue-generation and market-targeting goals.Understand the Rate Parity dynamics globallyWith the rolling out of announcements such as the Macron law in France, it is likely that rate parity may soon bid Europe goodbye. In addition, countries like the US are also catching up with the trend. This brings both challenges because of a major change in revenue management and rate parity, and an enormous potential for growth. The time now is ripe for hoteliers to ramp up their strategy to drive in as much direct booking traffic, and reverse the approach of excessive dependence on OTAs for reservations.However, do keep in mind that the absence of rate parity does not translate to an absolute absence of OTAs. They have a mark in the industry, so strong, and play an important role in the whole market dynamics of room distribution and booking. Hence, OTAs, meta-search engines and direct bookings are all different media of distribution that can fruitfully coexist in your hospitality ecosystem, as long as an optimum balance is maintained. To conclude, in the current situation hotels should invest in a progressive Rate Parity solution. An inclusive tool that enables hotels to not only identify the cause of rate parity but also assist them with an end-to-end solution to it. A tool that can provide insights about the overall enterprise level parity, a performance review of all the hotel chains, real-time buzz and a capability to connect with the concerned hotel chain and control the situation with real-time tracking.",https://rategain.com/blog/tips-hotel-manage-rate-parity-issue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rate-Parity-_2-Important-Tips-to-cope-up-with-Rate-Parity-Issues.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rate-Parity-_2-Important-Tips-to-cope-up-with-Rate-Parity-Issues.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Blog,,,Rate intelligence,Rate parity,,,,,,0
65632781a3f6fc78b8eba150,-201555864,What is Hotel Rate Parity? Why is it Important in the Hotel Industry?,"May 15, 2023","In the dynamic and competitive landscape of the hotel industry, maintaining consistent pricing across various distribution channels is crucial for hoteliers. This is where the concept of hotel rate parity comes into play. Rate parity refers to the practice of offering the same room rates and terms across all distribution channels.However, to be able to use it to your advantage, it is important to understand the intricacies of rate or price parity and why it is integral to maintain an upper hand in the everlasting fight to boost bookings and guest experience.Table of ContentsWhat is Hotel Rate Parity?Rate parity, also known as price parity, is the practice of ensuring that the room rates offered by a hotel are consistent across all distribution channels. It means that whether a potential guest books directly through the hotel’s website, a third-party online travel agency (OTA), or any other distribution partner, the rates should be identical. Rate parity extends beyond the room rates and includes terms and conditions, availability, and booking policies.The purpose of rate parity is to create a level playing field for all distribution channels and avoid price discrepancies that could lead to customer confusion or dissatisfaction. And it is is essential for maintaining fairness, brand integrity, and customer trust in the hotel industry. What is the Importance of Rate Parity?Rate parity holds significant importance in the hotel industry for several reasons. Let’s explore why it is crucial for hotels to maintain rate parity across their distribution channels:Fairness and ConsistencyRate parity ensures fairness and consistency in pricing for all customers, regardless of the channel through which they make a reservation. It eliminates price discrimination and ensures that guests receive the same rate regardless of where they book. This fosters trust among customers and enhances their confidence in the hotel’s pricing integrity.Avoiding Brand DilutionMaintaining rate parity helps protect the hotel’s brand image and reputation. When rates vary widely across different channels, it can create confusion and dilute the hotel’s brand perception. Consistent pricing across channels reinforces the hotel’s value proposition and avoids any negative impact on brand equity.Eliminating Customer FrustrationInconsistent pricing can lead to customer frustration and a sense of unfairness. Guests who discover a lower rate on one channel after booking through another may feel deceived or cheated. Rate parity ensures that customers feel confident in their booking decisions, knowing they are getting the best available rate ane the right pricing regardless of the booking channel.Preventing Channel ConflictRate parity helps prevent channel conflict and maintains healthy relationships with distribution partners. When rates are not aligned, it can create tension between the hotel and its online travel agency (OTA) partners, leading to strained partnerships and potential loss of business. Maintaining rate parity promotes collaboration and a mutually beneficial working relationship with distribution partners.Maximizing Revenue and Direct BookingsRate parity allows hotels to optimize revenue and prevent revenue leakage. When rates are consistent across channels, guests are less likely to shop around extensively, increasing the likelihood of direct bookings. By driving direct bookings, hotels can reduce distribution costs associated with commissions paid to third-party channels and retain more revenue.Enhancing Rate Management EfficiencyManaging rates across multiple channels can be complex and time-consuming. Rate parity simplifies rate management processes by providing a standard pricing structure that can be easily monitored and updated. This improves operational efficiency and reduces the risk of errors or discrepancies in pricing.Regulatory ComplianceRate parity has gained regulatory attention in some jurisdictions. Regulatory bodies have implemented rules and regulations to ensure fair competition and prevent anti-competitive practices. Adhering to rate parity requirements helps hotels comply with these regulations and avoid potential legal issues or penalties.\nBy ensuring consistent pricing across all distribution channels, hotels can optimize revenue, strengthen partnerships, and provide a positive booking experience for their guests. Embracing rate parity as a strategic approach is crucial for long-term success in the dynamic and competitive hospitality landscape.Is Rate Parity a Good or a Bad thing?Rate parity has been a subject of debate within the hotel industry. Some argue that rate parity helps maintain fairness and prevents rate undercutting among distribution channels. It ensures a consistent brand image, prevents customer confusion, and fosters healthy competition among online platforms. On the other hand, critics argue that rate parity limits hoteliers’ pricing flexibility, stifles competition, and increases dependency on OTAs.What are the Challenges in Maintaining Rate Parity?Maintaining rate parity poses several challenges for hoteliers.Dynamic hotel marketOne of the primary challenges is the dynamic nature of the hotel market, with rates constantly fluctuating based on demand, seasonality, and other factors. Hoteliers need to ensure that changes in rates are promptly reflected across all channels to avoid rate disparity.Managing multiple channelsManaging multiple distribution channels simultaneously, each with its own extranet or connectivity requirements, requires robust technology and efficient processes to update rates and availability in real-time. This poses additional challenge for the hoteliers.Price cutting by OTAsMore often than not, OTAs are allowed to reduce their own commission; thereby offering lower prices. As OTAs start getting a lion’s share of the bookings, hotels tend to lose out on revenue.Increasing direct bookingsDirect bookings are pivotal to boost the revenue share. This requires hotels to level-up their digital marketing — particularly metasearch marketing efforts.One obvious solution that comes to the mind is to exclude entire rooms from OTAs’ listings. However, this poses the risk of having unsold room inventory.How to Turn Rate Parity to Your Advantage?While rate parity ensures consistent pricing across distribution channels, it doesn’t mean that hotels can’t leverage this concept to their advantage. Here are some strategies to maximize the benefits of rate parity and differentiate your hotel from online travel agencies (OTAs):Provide More Value Than OTAsWhile OTAs may offer competitive rates, hotels can set themselves apart by providing additional value-added services and perks. Focus on enhancing the guest experience by offering exclusive amenities, personalized services, loyalty programs, or special packages. Highlight these unique selling points on your website and marketing materials to entice guests to book directly with your hotel.Market to Specific AudiencesInstead of solely relying on general marketing campaigns, tailor your marketing efforts to specific audiences. Identify niche markets or target segments that align with your hotel’s unique offerings and value proposition. By understanding the needs and preferences of these audiences, you can craft personalized messages and promotions that resonate with them. This targeted approach can attract guests who value the distinct experience your hotel provides, increasing direct bookings.Read More: How do Hotels Distribute Inventory to Drive BookingsUse Metasearch WebsitesMetasearch websites aggregate rates from various sources, including OTAs and hotel websites, allowing users to compare prices in one place. By participating in metasearch advertising, you can ensure your hotel appears alongside OTA listings, maintaining rate parity while increasing visibility. Optimizing your presence on metasearch platforms through competitive bidding, attractive visuals, and compelling descriptions can drive direct bookings and minimize reliance on OTAs.Improve the Booking ProcessStreamline and optimize your hotel’s online booking process to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience. Invest in a modern and intuitive booking engine that allows guests to easily navigate through the reservation process, customize their stay, and receive instant confirmation. Implement features like live chat support or virtual concierge services to address any concerns or queries promptly. A hassle-free booking process encourages guests to book directly, knowing they can easily secure the best available rate without any complications.Use a Channel ManagerA channel manager is a powerful tool that can help you effectively manage rates and inventory across multiple channels in real time. By using a channel manager, you can efficiently update rates, availability, and restrictions across all channels simultaneously, ensuring rate parity at all times. Additionally, a channel manager enables you to make data-driven decisions, monitor performance, and adjust strategies based on market demand and competitor analysis. This level of control and flexibility can enhance revenue management and minimize rate disparities.By leveraging these strategies, hotels can optimize their direct booking potential while adhering to rate parity requirements. Remember, building strong relationships with guests and providing exceptional experiences are key to fostering loyalty and encouraging repeat visits, further reducing dependence on OTAs.How can Hotels Manage Rate Parity Seamlessly?Hoteliers can adopt certain techniques and strategies to effectively manage rate parity.Never agree to Channel Specific PromotionsTo maintain rate parity, it’s crucial not to offer exclusive promotions or discounts through specific channels. This practice can create rate disparities and harm your relationship with other distribution partners. Instead, focus on providing consistent rates and value-added benefits across all channels to ensure a fair playing field for all distribution partners.Clarify your PoliciesClearly communicate your rate parity policies to all distribution partners and ensure they understand the expectations. Outline the consequences of rate disparities and emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent rates. Regularly review and update your agreements with distribution partners to ensure everyone is aligned with your rate parity strategy.Think of the Long-term Sales StrategyRate parity should be viewed as part of your long-term sales strategy rather than a short-term tactic. Consider the potential impact on your brand reputation and relationships with distribution partners. Building trust and maintaining strong partnerships can result in better negotiating power and more favorable terms in the future.Advertise the Benefits of Direct BookingsEducate your potential guests about the benefits of booking directly with your hotel. Emphasize advantages such as best price guarantee, exclusive offers, loyalty program perks, and personalized services. Highlight these benefits on your website, social media channels, and marketing campaigns to encourage guests to book directly, reducing reliance on OTAs and minimizing rate disparities.Reward Loyal GuestsImplement a robust loyalty program to incentivize guests to book directly and establish a sense of loyalty. Offer exclusive rewards, discounts, room upgrades, or additional amenities for repeat bookings or direct bookings. By recognizing and rewarding loyal guests, you can encourage them to bypass OTAs and book directly, fostering rate parity and building customer loyalty.Invest in your WebsiteEnsure that your hotel website is user-friendly, visually appealing, and optimized for direct bookings. Provide a seamless booking experience with clear rate information, intuitive navigation, and secure payment options. Invest in professional website design, mobile responsiveness, and fast loading times to enhance the user experience and encourage direct bookings.Read More: Why Ease of Use is the Core of any Booking Engine?Monitor your RatesRegularly monitor your rates across all distribution channels to identify any discrepancies or potential rate violations. Utilize rate shopping tools and analytics to track your rates and compare them with competitors. If you detect any inconsistencies, address them promptly with the respective distribution partners to rectify the situation and maintain rate parity.Negotiate Favorable TermsWhen entering into agreements with OTAs and other distribution partners, negotiate favorable terms that support your rate parity objectives. Seek agreements that allow you to manage your rates independently, provide flexibility in pricing strategies, and ensure fair competition among distribution partners. By having favorable terms in place, you can better manage rate parity while maximizing your revenue potential.By implementing these techniques, hotels can effectively manage rate parity and minimize rate disparities across various distribution channels. Consistency, transparency, and a proactive approach are key to maintaining rate parity and optimizing direct bookings. Remember, rate parity not only benefits the hotel industry as a whole but also fosters fair competition and enhances guest trust and satisfaction.How to Build Your Rate Parity Strategy?Creating a comprehensive rate parity strategy is crucial for hotels. It starts with a thorough analysis of the distribution landscape, identifying key distribution partners, and understanding their requirements. Developing clear and standardized rate and inventory management policies that align with the hotel’s overall revenue strategy is essential. Regular audits and monitoring of distribution channels for rate parity compliance should be conducted to ensure consistency. Collaborating closely with distribution partners and negotiating favorable terms can also contribute to effective rate parity management.Ultimately, hotel rate parity fosters fairness and trust among customers, eliminates confusion, and promotes healthy competition in the online marketplace. With the right strategies and tools in place, hoteliers can seamlessly manage rate parity, enhance their brand reputation, drive direct bookings, optimize revenue, and achieve long-term success in the competitive hotel industry.If you wish to embrace rate parity and implementg the right strategies and tools to counter rate parity, book a live demo now.Further Read: 8 Easy Tips for Hotel Revenue Managers to Cope With Rate Parity Issues",https://rategain.com/blog/what-is-hotel-rate-parity/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rate-Parity-_1-What-is-Hotel-Rate-Parity-Why-is-it-Important.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rate-Parity-_1-What-is-Hotel-Rate-Parity-Why-is-it-Important.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Rate intelligence,Rate parity,,,,,,0

65632784a3f6fc78b8eba154,1387217540,Crucial Hotel Sales Strategies to Boost Occupancy and Revenue,"May 14, 2023","As a hotelier, your goal may be to offer a superlative guest experience, yet you do not disregard the fact that you are essentially administering an enterprise. Ergo, the art of vending hotel accommodations is quintessential to your triumph as a hospitality manager or operator.The key to success lies in prioritizing guest experience while also focusing on maximizing room occupancy, regardless of the season. This means developing effective hotel sales strategies to ensure profitability and a thriving business strategy.Table of ContentsHotel Sales StrategiesAn unoccupied hotel is a nightmare for hoteliers, indicating a failed business strategy. To avoid this situation, hoteliers must implement sales strategies that attract guests and ensure a steady flow of business, even during the slower travel season. Selling as many rooms as possible is crucial to driving revenue, which enables hoteliers to invest in the hotel’s future and provide the level of service that guests expect.Prioritizing hotel room sales techniques helps to create the atmosphere that guests anticipate. A vacant or nearly empty hotel can leave a negative impression on guests. Selling as many rooms as possible ensures that the hotel remains lively and dynamic, which is important for guest satisfaction. To achieve this, hoteliers must develop sales strategies tailored to their target market and local destination, considering effective hotel room sales strategies such as those outlined below.Six Essential Strategies for Hotel Room SalesHotel Group Sales StrategyThis strategy requires a shift in marketing and sales approach to corporate target groups. Offering deals on rooms and meeting spaces to these groups can lead to repeat business. To secure group bookings, it is most cost-effective to connect directly with planners. You can list your property on venue marketplaces where planners can view floorplans, photos, and unique features. Segmentation of your target audience will allow for more compelling offers to the appropriate groups for your property.Hotel Direct Sales StrategyThis strategy aims to generate as many direct bookings online from guests as possible. Direct bookings are ideal for hotel operators because they generate the highest revenue without the need to pay commissions to agents or distribution partners. To implement a direct booking strategy, hotel managers should invest in an online booking system that integrates with their website and property management system. Additionally, prioritizing a social media strategy can help increase direct bookings.Collaborative Destination Marketing Sales StrategyThis sales strategy involves hotels partnering with other tourism businesses in their local destination to promote the region as a whole. The goal is to work together to create a destination marketing campaign that targets inbound tourism markets and increases overall traffic to the area.Cross-Promotion Sales StrategyWith this sales strategy, hotel managers identify major events in the local area throughout the year and develop promotions that coincide with them. This allows them to capitalize on the influx of visitors attending the events and generate bookings they may not have had otherwise. Conferences, concerts, and sporting events are ideal opportunities for cross-promotional sales strategies.Guest Rewards Sales StrategyMany travelers, particularly millennials, value rewards programs and are more likely to do business with companies that offer them. Hotels have had great success with rewards programs, which often generate repeat bookings and referrals. In a guest rewards sales strategy, hotel operators develop a system that rewards guests for frequent stays, upgrades, and referrals to friends and family.Revenue Management Sales StrategyThis sales strategy aims to maximize the number of rooms booked throughout the year, regardless of typical travel traffic patterns. Revenue management plans require hotels to drop room rates during the low season to encourage bookings while raising rates during high traffic times. This allows hotels to generate more revenue per available room during peak periods when guests are willing to pay higher rates.Read More: Revolutionizing Guest Experiences and Revenue Management with AIOther Tactics to Boost Hotel RevenueIn addition to larger sales strategies, several smaller tactics can be used to increase hotel room sales and generate more revenue from each guest.

65632785a3f6fc78b8eba156,2133627914,What is a Hotel Channel Manager? How Do You Choose the Perfect One?,"May 14, 2023","In today’s digital era, hoteliers face the challenge of keeping their rates in sync, expanding to hundreds of new distribution channels, and maximizing the occupancy of their hotels.

It allows hotels to distribute their inventory to various online travel agencies (OTAs); including Booking.com, Expedia.com, and Airbnb.What is the role of a Channel Management Software?A channel manager acts as a centralized hub, connecting your hotel’s property management system (PMS) with various online distribution channels such as online travel agencies (OTAs), global distribution systems (GDSs), metasearch engines, and the hotel’s own website. Its primary function is to automate the distribution of room inventory, rates, and availability across these channels in real-time. By doing so, it eliminates manual updates and minimizes the risk of overbookings or underbookings. Additionally, it provides comprehensive reporting and analytics to track performance, optimize revenue, and make informed pricing decisions.What are the benefits of using a Channel Management Software?Implementing a channel management solution offers numerous benefits for hotels, including:What are the key factors to consider when choosing a Channel Management Software?Selecting the perfect channel manager for your hotel requires careful evaluation of several key factors:End notesA hotel channel management software is a vital tool to efficiently distribute their room inventory across multiple online channels, ensuring real-time updates, rate parity, and increased online visibility.

65632786a3f6fc78b8eba158,1304678340,How Can Content Solve The Expectation Gap for Hotels?,"May 13, 2023","Content is the key to effective and targeted communication from the industry’s end to the customer in today’s hospitality landscape. Content is a lot more dynamic now and has reignited as one of the key revenue drivers for any hotel in the industry. For example, 51% of travelers in the U.S.A. spend around seven days before a trip conducting research. You will most likely lose a conversion if they aren’t greeted with fresh content about your hotel and notice a content disparity across different channels.  Content is at the center of not only hotels and hoteliers but also GDS platforms and OTAs. But the impact of content is only seen when it is distributed uniformly across all channels. Steer yourself from the misconception that you must focus on updating content on some of your most responsive and active OTAs and channels. Content must be distributed consistently across all of your channels.But won’t that be very tedious? How can they monitor and update every channel at once when hotels and hoteliers use so many different channels? If you wish to find out, read on!Current State of Content Management in HotelsContent is crucial to every hotel’s distribution and management strategy. Content is much more dynamic than most hoteliers, and other hospitality industry members give it credit. Giving you the ability to relay critical information to your partners and customers instantly, content is one of the biggest revenue drivers in 2022. But why so? Why is investing in content so necessary? Simply put, you need content to accurately communicate the information you want to convey to your customer. Therefore, having better and more optimized content will result in more excellent traction on OTA platforms and across channels.A 2019 survey by Expedia states that for the average traveler, 50% of their decisions are influenced by informative content. Other factors that are involved in the decision-making process include appealing imagery (54%), deals (53%), simple language (35%), etc. This is why providing your customers and partners with up-to-date content is crucial. Additionally, if your content is inconsistent across channels and platforms, you will make the customer’s booking experience unpleasant.Furthermore, many companies usually experience the cold start problem, where hotels will latch onto an OTA and focus all their content creation efforts on that particular OTA. They’ll quickly get onto this OTA without enough content. Once the content doesn’t kick off, they have less incentive to update the content again. As a result, content retakes a backseat, killing the opportunity for a great start to your content marketing strategy. As a result, they get caught in a vicious cycle, and the content is never released. The number of interactions in the industry (between hotels, visitors, OTAs, GDSs, etc.) makes it challenging to accurately distribute all the rooms. Furthermore, what may be effective in one area or channel may not be applicable elsewhere. How can this content gap be filled? How can you ensure that all platforms and channels have the same content?The solution lies in the power of AI.AI-powered Hotel Content Management SystemBefore the onset of the pandemic, content updating was done manually by quite a few hotels. In fact, a lot of hoteliers used to maintain a manual excel sheet of all the properties they owned. Even then, they would record the property scores and let the partners know if the score fell short of expectations.This was quite a cumbersome process, which was eventually eliminated by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it can be very challenging to keep up with the developments across all of your channels when there are so many content interactions taking place at once in the hospitality sector.Some say it is impossible, but is it?What if you had an AI-based content distribution tool at your disposal? What if you could update all of your content parameters on a single screen paired with a scoring engine that also provides content recommendations? What if you could do all this, and go beyond possible?This is precisely what Content-AI — RateGain’s brand new AI-based tool — does for you.What is Content-AI? Why do you need it?Content-AI happens to be the first of its kind hotel content management system, leveraging AI capabilities to boost conversion rates, engagement, and revenue. A broken hotel management and distribution playbook will lose you a lot of revenue. In fact, maintaining content parity across countless channels and demand partners has become an absolute task. With Content-AI at your disposal, you can improve content strength across all your preferred channels and demand partners. Some features that come paired with the platform are as follows:With the massive push towards the importance of content in the hospitality industry, there is a lot of chaos regarding the exchange of information and rates across multiple platforms. The difficulty of keeping track of all your channel activity can directly contribute to the staffing shortage the hospitality sector is currently experiencing. Why employ more people when you can have AI segregate your entire content distribution process? Maintaining content parity across every channel you use is necessary, and that is precisely what Content-AI does for you. A robust platform that collates all your content parameters on one screen is perfect for taking on your content distribution and management woes. Thus, make wise rather than impulsive content investment decisions. Allow Content-AI to take control of your business’s content distribution, and watch as your ROI soars to the heights you’ve always dreamed of.

65632788a3f6fc78b8eba15a,1844184823,Changing Markets Post-Pandemic: Guest Behaviors Changing Booking Inspiration,"May 11, 2023","As the pandemic gradually creeps out, travel is making a strong comeback. But this comeback brought about monumental changes in guest behavior and booking inspiration. Post pandemic, hoteliers were simply playing catch up to meet the ever-evolving demands of the ‘changed’ customer.But what ‘changed’? How has the general traveler behavior and booking mentality changed since the world came out of its quarantined walls?The change is quite significant, and cannot be brushed off without a proper breakdown. The following article sheds light on the changes brought around by the pandemic, and how hoteliers all around the world have had to adopt.Read on to know more!Table of ContentsHow have Hotels evolved in the pandemic?The constant shift between lockdown and travel restrictions has taught hotels the importance of leveraging data. But how? What difference will data make to the survival of the hospitality industry?This constant shift taught hoteliers to be on their toes, and leverage available technology to get to know the customer better. On the surface, this technology simply provided hoteliers a faster means to connect with the customer.However, the data collected by these systems helped hoteliers understand their customers and their booking inspiration. Naturally, they can now match the constantly shifting customer expectations, since they understand the customer better.In the current technological landscape, everything from transactions to bookings, has to be seamless and preferably follow an omnichannel experience.In essence, the constant fluctuations caused by the pandemic in these past few years has now taught hotels to understand their surroundings a lot better. This understanding comes from the insights you derive from all the data at your fingertips. The bottom line is that the pandemic highlighted the importance of making conscious, timely, and data-driven decisions.The difference in guest behavior post-pandemic: Booking inspiration editionBefore we look at the changes brought about by the pandemic, let’s first understand the scale at which events occurred. To do this, let’s consider an example. Back in 2010, the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupted, and it spread ash all across the continent.As a result, all the flights above Europe had to be canceled, and tourism took a significant hit. Now ponder about this for a second. If a volcano eruption can slow down business in hotels, what damage can a multi-year full-scale global pandemic do?The pandemic forced digitalization due to remote work culture, and now customer expectations are technology-driven as well. Hotels must be technologically equipped and arrange for a seamless online experience for higher conversions. In fact, this technology adoption by the hospitality industry reduced guest complaints by a whopping 71%.Read Also: Digitalisation is the shortcut you need for better guest satisfactionAs a result, the guests’ booking patterns and inspiration have also seen quite some change. Their perspective towards traveling has changed, and so you have to adapt accordingly. Here are some pointers to help you understand these changes:Leisure firstThe post-pandemic era has seen a higher percentage of guests who have booked a stay for leisure purposes. This shares a direct correlation with the fact that people haven’t traveled in the past few years, and now that the restrictions are a little more relaxed, hotels are seeing an influx of vacationersIn fact, Elizabeth Schultz — Vice President of guest experience, strategy, and innovation at Hyatt Hotels Corporation — states, “A much higher percentage of our guests are leisure guests.”So, guests will be looking for an experience that can provide them value.Furthermore, another survey conducted by Hyatt also stated that guests are willing to drive a lot more than they were ready to before the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, guests would drive for a maximum of 2-4 hours to their getaway destination.Now, guests are ready to drive up to 8 hours continuously to get to their destination.Tighter bookingThe uncertainty and constant flux created by the uncertainty of COVID spikes have shortened the booking window considerably. Guests used to book well in advance, but this practice faded away with the onset of pandemic-related trends.With such a short booking window, hotels have to expect an increase in last-minute bookings and impatient guests.Guests are now more cautious and tech-savvy.If nothing, two years of remote work has made almost every person more cautious and tech-savvy. So, your outdated website and clunky UI will no longer work. Furthermore, there is no scope for inaccuracy on your website either. With the general audience being fairly proficient at navigating websites, they will look at every tiny detail on the webpage.This is because they need to trust the hotel before they can come and stay in it. It is no longer just about amenities or ambiance, but also about sanitation and COVID-prevention measures.Unless the guest can trust that you are offering them a safe experience, they will not even think about booking.Furthermore, the new-age customer is also looking for a seamless omnichannel experience. So don’t just update your website, but integrate powerful technological tools (e.g., CRM) to engage your guests in the best way possible.Value-buying now trumps brand loyaltyThe rise of the leisure traveler has brought about the downfall of brand loyalty. The leisure traveler has their eyes set on finding a property that suits their needs.It rarely happens that these leisure travelers repeat a hotel brand or a destination. As a result, these hoteliers are now directing their efforts toward keeping their travelers informed and updated.A significant expansion in traveler baseWith the rise of leisure travelers, the overall global traveler base has also seen a significant hike. This has especially been noticed in the Asian economy, where high disposable income millennials are taking almost 3-4 trips every year.Moreover, a higher life expectancy of baby boomers and Gen-Xers, paired with their high net worth and financial security, has widened the traveller base further. They are now capable of spending a lot more on travel. Furthermore, they also spend a lot more time traveling now.Wrapping upThe COVID-19 pandemic brought about tremendous setbacks for the travel and tourism industry. But the silver lining in this situation was data and technology adoption. Now, the functionality of the hospitality industry is much more channel driven, and you have to be proficient at keeping track of all of them.For instance, you might get an influx of guests from a particular OTA (Online Travel Agency). Or maybe it is your GDS. What then? What GDS is it? What type of business is it bringing in?You must be on top of all these channels and focus your marketing efforts on them. But remember one thing. Whatever you do to drive guests to your hotel must have an ROI to support it. Be smart about it, back your decisions with data, and offer your guests a satisfying experience.The article has been written based on the insights gathered from industry leaders.Watch the Complete VideoMeet the SpeakersFurther Read: Revolutionizing Guest Experiences and Revenue Management with AI",https://rategain.com/blog/guest-behaviors-changing-booking-inspiration/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Changing-Markets-Post-Pandemic-Guest-Behaviors-Changing-Booking-Inspiration.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Changing-Markets-Post-Pandemic-Guest-Behaviors-Changing-Booking-Inspiration.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hospitality-statistics.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/April-300x300.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Krista-300x300.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/James-300x300.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,,,,,,,,0
65632789a3f6fc78b8eba15c,-631561409,What is Hotel Occupancy Rate? How to Calculate it?,"May 6, 2023","Occupancy rate refers to the percentage of available units in a building or facility that are currently occupied by tenants or users. It is commonly used in the real estate industry to measure the level of demand for a particular property or market.A high occupancy rate is generally considered to be a positive sign for property owners, as it indicates strong demand for their units and the potential for higher rental income. Conversely, a low occupancy rate may indicate that a property is not as attractive to tenants or that there is excess supply in the market.Table of ContentsWhat is the formula for occupancy rate?The formula for occupancy rate is:Occupancy Rate = (Number of Occupied Units / Total Number of Available Units) x 100%For example, if a hotel has 100 rooms available and 80 of them are occupied, the occupancy rate would be:Occupancy Rate = (80 / 100) x 100% = 80%This means that 80% of the hotel’s available rooms are currently occupied. The occupancy rate is usually expressed as a percentage and is commonly used in the real estate industry to measure the demand for a particular property or market.How and when to calculate a hotel’s occupancy rate?A hotel’s occupancy rate is typically calculated on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. To calculate the occupancy rate of a hotel, you need to follow these steps:Determine the total number of available rooms in the hotel during the period you are interested in measuring. For example, if you want to measure the occupancy rate for a day, you would use the total number of available rooms on that particular day.Count the number of rooms that are occupied during the same period. This can be done by counting the number of rooms that are checked-in or occupied by guests during the period.Calculate the occupancy rate using the formula:Occupancy rate = (Number of Occupied Rooms / Total Number of Available Rooms) x 100%For example, if the hotel has 200 available rooms and 150 of them are occupied on a particular day, the occupancy rate would be:Occupancy rate = (150 / 200) x 100% = 75%This means that the hotel’s occupancy rate for that day is 75%.It’s important to note that the formula can also be applied to longer time periods, such as a week or a month, by using the total number of available rooms and the total number of occupied rooms during that period. The occupancy rate is an important metric for hotel operators, as it provides insight into the hotel’s performance and can help them make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and operations.What is the average occupancy rate in the hotel industry?The average occupancy rate in the hotel industry varies depending on a number of factors such as location, type of hotel, and time of year. However, as a general rule, a healthy occupancy rate for hotels is typically considered to be around 70-80%.In the United States, the average occupancy rate for hotels was around 44% in 2020, which was significantly lower than in previous years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the occupancy rate has been gradually recovering as travel restrictions ease and vaccination rates increase.It’s important to note that the occupancy rate is just one of many metrics used to measure the performance of a hotel. Other important metrics include average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and gross operating profit per available room (GOPPAR). These metrics are often used in combination to provide a more comprehensive view of a hotel’s financial performance.Why is the hotel occupancy rate important?The hotel occupancy rate is an important metric for several reasons:Overall, the hotel occupancy rate is a key performance indicator for hotel operators and investors, as it provides insight into the financial performance, pricing strategy, market demand, and operational efficiency of a hotel.Further Read: What are the Important Statistics in the Hotel Industry?",https://rategain.com/blog/hotel-occupancy-rate/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Occupancy-Rate-and-calculation.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Occupancy-Rate-and-calculation.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,Distribution,Occupancy Rates,Rate intelligence,,,,,0
6563278aa3f6fc78b8eba15e,-1339606895,Is RevPAR the Best Metric to Measure Profitability?,"May 5, 2023","RevPAR stands for Revenue Per Available Room, which is a key performance metric used in the hotel industry to evaluate a hotel’s financial performance. RevPAR is calculated by multiplying a hotel’s average daily room rate (ADR) by its occupancy rate.The formula for calculating RevPAR is as follows:RevPAR = ADR x Occupancy RateFor example, if a hotel has an ADR of $150 and an occupancy rate of 80%, the RevPAR would be $120 ($150 x 0.80 = $120). This means that on average, the hotel is generating $120 in revenue per available room.RevPAR is a useful metric because it takes into account both a hotel’s occupancy rate and its room rates. A hotel can increase its RevPAR by either increasing its room rates, improving its occupancy rate, or a combination of both.RevPAR can be used to evaluate a hotel’s performance over time or compared to other hotels in the same market. It can also be used to forecast future revenue and adjust pricing strategies to optimize revenue.How is it different from GOPPAR?GOPPAR stands for Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room, and it is another important performance metric used in the hotel industry. While RevPAR measures a hotel’s revenue performance, GOPPAR measures its profitability by taking into account all of the hotel’s operating expenses, including labor costs, overhead expenses, and other costs of operations.The formula for calculating GOPPAR is as follows:GOPPAR = Total Revenue – Total Operating Expenses / Number of Available RoomsFor example, if a hotel has a total revenue of $500,000 and total operating expenses of $350,000, and it has 200 available rooms, the GOPPAR would be $750 (($500,000 – $350,000) / 200 = $750). This means that on average, the hotel is generating a gross profit of $750 per available room.GOPPAR is a more comprehensive metric than RevPAR, as it takes into account a hotel’s profitability and not just its revenue. A hotel can increase its GOPPAR by reducing its operating expenses, improving operational efficiency, or increasing revenue while maintaining or reducing expenses.Both RevPAR and GOPPAR are important metrics that provide insights into a hotel’s financial performance. RevPAR is a revenue metric that measures a hotel’s top-line performance, while GOPPAR is a profitability metric that takes into account all operating expenses to provide a more comprehensive view of a hotel’s financial health.Should hotels consider TREVPAR as the benchmark?TREVPAR, which stands for Total Revenue Per Available Room, is a metric that takes into account all revenue streams generated by a hotel, including rooms, food and beverage, and other ancillary services. It provides a more comprehensive view of a hotel’s revenue performance than RevPAR, which only takes into account revenue generated from rooms.While TREVPAR can be a useful benchmark for evaluating a hotel’s overall revenue performance, it may not be the most appropriate benchmark for all hotels. The suitability of TREVPAR as a benchmark depends on the specific characteristics of the hotel and its market.For example, if a hotel generates a significant portion of its revenue from food and beverage or other ancillary services, then TREVPAR may be a more appropriate benchmark than RevPAR. On the other hand, if a hotel primarily focuses on room revenue and has limited food and beverage or other ancillary services, then RevPAR may be a more appropriate benchmark.In addition, hotels may also consider other performance metrics such as GOPPAR (Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room) or NOI (Net Operating Income) as benchmarks to evaluate their financial performance.Ultimately, the choice of benchmark should be tailored to the specific hotel and its market, taking into account its revenue mix, competitive landscape, and other factors that may impact its financial performance.",https://rategain.com/blog/is-revpar-the-best-metric-to-measure-profitability/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Is-RevPAR-the-Best-Metric-to-Measure-Profitability-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Is-RevPAR-the-Best-Metric-to-Measure-Profitability-scaled.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,Rate intelligence,Revpar,,,,,0
6563278ca3f6fc78b8eba160,-1692013110,Why Should Hotels Update Content On OTAs Frequently?,"May 5, 2023","Picture this: There is a man who used to work for ten solid hours. As soon as he clocked out of his office, he would see his friends, have some beer, watch a football match and sleep the night away. On weekends, he would go for mini excursions, treks, or bowling.This was a story of a lot of people, who strived to have a good work-life balance. Even when people such as the one in our example planned their vacations, they were more on the lines of discovering a new place and exploring an unknown culture.Then, the pandemic hit, and life as we knew it changed.Today, the same person has been working from home all day long, like the most of us. The lines between personal and professional lives have blurred as he never gets to clock out from work.

Among the most renowned metasearch websites are Trivago, Tripadvisor, and Google Hotel Ads.By utilizing metasearch engines, travelers can effortlessly access real-time information on room prices and availability, all displayed in a single view and do not need to go to different websites, saving time.Unlike other ad types such as SEM, display, and social, metasearch results are triggered by users entering the dates of their trip. Metasearch is the only channel that has the capability to display live rates with a direct path to the hotel website, distinguishing it from other channels however most hotels are unable to take advantage of these features.This makes metasearch a highly valuable advertising channel for hotels. It is important to note that in all probability if you have a hotel website, then you are indexed on a metasearch, however, your team might not be making the most use of the platform and could potentially be losing customers who might be looking to book directly on your website.How can hotels drive bookings from Metasearch?To participate in metasearch advertising, advertisers must update rates using the ad properties available on the metasearch platform such as Google Hotel Ads or TripAdvisor ads, and program the rates basis different parameters provided by the metasearch engines to manage rates.However hotels that want to manage inventory, rates, and availability seamlessly on the metasearch engines would also want to use a channel manager, if they are not only looking at advertising.Each metasearch engine operates in accordance with its unique pricing, ranking, and bidding logic, which leads to an intricate management process for these campaigns.The Benefits of Metasearch AdvertisingIncreased visibilityManaging content on multiple OTAs can be time-consuming and resource-intensive for hotels, especially for smaller properties with limited staff. Updating rates, availability, and descriptions across multiple channels can be a complex and ongoing process, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.Targeted advertisingMetasearch engines offer targeted advertising options, allowing hotels to reach travelers who are searching for specific destinations, dates, or amenities. This can help hotels to attract the right audience and increase the likelihood of direct bookings.Improved conversion ratesMetasearch engines offer a streamlined booking process, with a clear call-to-action and an easy-to-use reservation system. This can lead to improved conversion rates for direct bookings, as travelers are more likely to book directly with the hotel when the booking process is simple and user-friendly.Competitive pricingMetasearch engines allow hotels to offer competitive pricing for direct bookings, with exclusive promotions and discounts that are not available through third-party channels. This can incentivize travelers to book directly with the hotel, leading to increased direct bookings and improved revenue performance.Helping in a comprehensive & multichannel marketing strategyTo claim a complete multichannel marketing strategy, you cannot overlook the significance of metasearch. These platforms are highly popular among travelers, particularly in the mid-to-lower funnel stage, when they have already decided on the destination and timeframe of their trip. By prioritizing metasearch advertising, you can ensure that your brand remains at the forefront of the traveler’s mind during the final booking, resulting in higher direct bookings.Metasearch has proven to be a powerful channel in boosting hotel visibility and driving direct bookings. As a mid-to-low funnel marketing tactic, it targets highly qualified traffic and boasts a high conversion rate. By shifting share away from OTAs and offering enhanced exposure to encourage a direct experience for the consumer, metasearch sets hotels up for success in the future by minimizing the impact of campaign performance dips that are likely to result from cookie-reliant channels.Adding metasearch to a comprehensive, multichannel marketing strategy is essential for hoteliers who seek to build exceptional customer relationships, maximize direct bookings, and achieve higher margins over time.",https://rategain.com/blog/why-metasearch-is-critical-for-your-direct-bookings-strategy/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Metasearch-is-critical-for-your-hotels-Direct-Bookings-Strategy-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Metasearch-is-critical-for-your-hotels-Direct-Bookings-Strategy-scaled.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Direct Bookings,Distribution,Inventory Management,Metasearch Marketing,,,,0
65632790a3f6fc78b8eba164,-1342371555,Why Content on OTAs is Critical for Improving Conversion Rates,"May 3, 2023","In today’s world, when customers rely on online travel agencies (OTAs) to make hotel bookings, it is crucial for hotels to have accurate, complete, and engaging content on OTAs to improve their conversion rates. Unfortunately, many hotels lack the time, resources, and automation tools to keep their content up-to-date across multiple channels, leading to inaccurate and outdated information. This can have a significant impact on a hotel’s reputation, bookings, and search result rankings.Table of ContentsWhy is it important to focus on hotel content on OTAs?Inaccurate or incomplete contentIf a hotel’s content on OTAs is outdated, inaccurate, or incomplete, it can lead to confusion or mistrust among potential guests, which can result in low conversion rates.For example, if there are no images of the hotel’s pool or fitness center, guests may assume that these amenities do not exist. Incomplete content can also make it difficult for potential guests to understand the hotel’s unique features or value proposition, leading them to book elsewhere.Lack of differentiationIf a hotel’s content on OTAs does not effectively differentiate the property from other options in the market, it can make it difficult to attract bookings and achieve high conversion rates.If a potential guest sees several options in the same location with similar rates and amenities, they are more likely to choose the option that stands out in some way. A lack of differentiation can make it difficult for the hotel to capture potential guests’ attention and convert them into bookings.To improve conversion rates, hotels should strive to provide complete, accurate, and engaging content that effectively communicates the hotel’s unique value proposition and differentiates it from other options in the market.What stops hotels from focusing on content?Time and resource constraintsManaging content on multiple OTAs can be time-consuming and resource-intensive for hotels, especially for smaller properties with limited staff. Updating rates, availability, and descriptions across multiple channels can be a complex and ongoing process, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.Lack of controlHotels may feel that they have limited control over their content on OTAs, as the information is often managed by the OTAs themselves. This can lead to outdated or inaccurate information, which can negatively impact the hotel’s reputation and bookings.Limited resourcesUpdating content can be a time-consuming task, and hotels with limited resources may struggle to prioritize it. Small hotels or those with a lean staff may have difficulty keeping up with the demands of managing their content across multiple channels.Complex distribution landscapeManaging content across multiple channels can be complex, as each platform may have different requirements and standards for content. This can make it challenging for hotels to keep their content consistent and up-to-date.Lack of automationManually updating content can be a tedious and error-prone process. Hotels that do not have systems in place to automate content updates may struggle to keep up with the volume of changes required to maintain accurate and up-to-date content.Communication breakdownsIn some cases, hotels may struggle to keep their content updated due to communication breakdowns with their channel partners or internal teams. For example, a hotel may update their rates in their property management system but fail to communicate these changes to their distribution partners, leading to outdated pricing information on third-party channels.With hotel content management solution, hotels can ensure their content is accurate, persuasive, and distributed seamlessly across third-party channels. This approach can boost bookings significantly without putting a strain on time or resources. Neglecting content can critically hamper the increase in travel and accommodation bookings.What type of content do hotels typically display on demand partner platforms?To begin with, hotel content on demand channels refers to the material on online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Booking.com and Expedia, as well as local sites. It comprises various types of content like photos, text descriptions, policies, and amenity information.A hotel typically has around 50 to 100 photos uploaded on various OTAs, GDSs, and other booking platforms. These include photos of the exterior, lobby, restaurant, bar, hallways, each room type, and other unique features. Furthermore, each photo must be labeled with relevant tags, like “Pool,” “Bathroom,” or “Fitness Center,” among others.Policies are critical aspects of any hotel’s demand partner listings as they convey crucial information to guests, such as check-in time, free cancellation deadlines, extra charges, if any, and pet and child policies.Demand channels continually introduce new content fields and additional options, such as specifying the type of coffee maker in the room.Why is regularly updating your hotel’s content on distribution channels critical?Updating hotel content regularly is crucial for two reasons: to boost search result placement and to ensure accurate and relevant listings. However, manually monitoring content scores across different demand partners can be daunting for hotel management companies and ownership groups.Typically, it requires 45 minutes to set up a new demand partner and 15 minutes to monitor a demand partner every month. Managing demanding partnerships with multiple parties can be time-consuming for hotel groups, often requiring significant labor hours. In most cases, dealing with more than ten demanding partners can exacerbate this issue.Here hotels need a centralized dashboard that allows quick wins to improve content scores without needing multiple extranet systems.Third-party sites often use “content completeness” as a factor in their search result ranking algorithms. This means that a high content score indicates that all important information, such as check-in/check-out times and parking, pool & spa, has been provided. It is essential for optimal placement.Hotel information is frequently updated to evolving requirements, ensuring content remains current. Despite these changing requirements, the necessary updates help to maintain up-to-date informationWhy is the Process Broken Today?Managing hotel content on distribution channels is often not prioritized by revenue managers or digital marketers, especially during staff shortages and increased workloads. However, it is becoming more time-consuming as demand partners require more detailed and updated content fields, such as COVID-19 safety measures and special rates for first responders.Additionally, the constantly changing nature of hotel policies and amenities due to evolving regulations and travel restrictions makes content management even more challenging.Despite these challenges, keeping hotel content up-to-date on distribution channels is essential for staying competitive. To improve search result rankings, third-party sites factor in the completeness of content when evaluating search results. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure all relevant fields are regularly updated and filled out to maximize search engine optimization (SEO).In the post-COVID world, travelers are more cautious about where they stay and spend more time researching hotels before booking. A recent study shows that travelers are plausible to share positive reviews if their experience exceeds expectations.Therefore, it becomes important for the hotels to provide accurate information about their cleanliness efforts, amenities, and policies across all channels.How AI facilitates and speeds up content maintenanceContent management can be time-consuming, especially when hoteliers have less time, more work, and greater pressure to provide a top-notch guest experience. However, with the help of AI, updating and distributing content across all channels can be quick and effortless. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) hoteliers can prioritize content updates, making delivering a positive guest experience easier.As travel resumes after the pandemic, it has become increasingly important for hotels to manage their content efficiently and ensure its accuracy. However, content management can be a daunting and time-consuming task for hotels.To address this challenge, cloud-based content management software solutions utilize artificial intelligence (AI), simplify content optimization, and enable hotels to distribute content across multiple demand partners seamlessly through a single interface.With auto-tagging of images, categorization by demand partners can be improved, leading to better SEO results. One-click distribution to demand partners saves hotels time and effort in updating their content, which can be especially valuable for hotels facing staff shortages or other operational challenges.Further Read: Why Should You Care About Hotel Content Management?",https://rategain.com/blog/why-content-on-otas-is-critical-for-improving-conversion-rates/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Content-Management-3-Why-Content-on-OTAs-is-Critical-for-Improving-Conversion-Rates-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Content-Management-3-Why-Content-on-OTAs-is-Critical-for-Improving-Conversion-Rates-scaled.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,Hotel Content Management,,,,,,0

One of the most important aspects of this industry is distribution, which refers to the process of getting hotel inventory to consumers through various channels. With the rise of online travel agencies (OTAs), hoteliers must navigate a complex distribution landscape to maximize their revenue and reach as many potential guests as possible.Table of ContentsWhy do hotels use third-party distribution channels?Increased ExposureBy listing their properties on third-party channels, hotels can reach a wider audience than they might be able to on their own. This can be especially useful for independent or small hotels that don’t have the resources to invest in large-scale marketing campaigns or distribution networks.Access to TechnologyThird-party channels often invest heavily in technology to optimize their search and booking processes, which can be expensive for hotels to develop and maintain on their own. By partnering with these channels, hotels can benefit from this technology without having to invest significant resources.Cost-Effective MarketingThird-party channels offer hotels a cost-effective way to market their properties, as they typically charge a commission on bookings rather than upfront fees. This can be especially beneficial for hotels that are just starting or have limited marketing budgets.Competitive EdgePartnering with third-party channels can help hotels compete with larger brands by providing access to a wider audience and more advanced technology.Distribution ManagementThird-party channels can help hotels manage their distribution by providing a single platform to manage their listings, inventory, and pricing across multiple channels. This can save hotels time and resources compared to managing their distribution independently.In the past, hotel distribution was relatively straightforward, with most bookings being made directly through the hotel or through traditional travel agents. However, the rise of the internet and the proliferation of OTAs has greatly expanded the distribution landscape, creating new challenges and opportunities for hotels.What are the different distribution channels available for the hotels?Today, hotels have a variety of distribution channels available to them. These include online travel agencies (OTAs), global distribution systems (GDS), metasearch engines, direct booking channels, and more.In addition to these traditional distribution channels, hotels can also take advantage of newer technologies, such as chatbots and voice assistants, to reach potential guests. For example, a hotel might use a chatbot on their website or Facebook page to answer guest questions and help them book a room.Navigating the distribution landscape can be challenging for hotels, as each channel has its own benefits and drawbacks. However, by using a combination of channels and leveraging the latest technologies, hotels can reach more guests and maximize their revenue.Ultimately, the key to success in the hotel industry is to understand the distribution landscape and use it to your advantage. By partnering with the right OTAs, utilizing meta-search engines, and promoting direct bookings, hotels can ensure they are reaching the widest possible audience and maximizing their revenue potential.Further Read: Why Metasearch is critical for your Direct Bookings Strategy",https://rategain.com/blog/how-hotels-distribute-inventory-to-drive-bookings/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-do-Hotels-Distribute-Inventory-to-Drive-Bookings-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-do-Hotels-Distribute-Inventory-to-Drive-Bookings-scaled.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,Inventory Management,OTAs,,,,,0

65632797a3f6fc78b8eba16e,1410211622,Sustainability: The Conversation We Need To Have With ChatGPT Today,"April 27, 2023","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the importance of sustainability into sharp focus, as people around the world have become acutely aware of the interconnectedness of our planet and the need for a more resilient and sustainable future.In the travel and hospitality industry, there has been a growing focus on sustainable practices and responsible tourism, with many companies implementing measures to reduce their environmental impact and support local communities. This shift towards sustainability is not only good for the planet but also for the long-term success of the industry.Table of ContentsUnderstanding Sustainable TravelSustainability in travel is about balancing the environmental, social, and economic impacts of travel to minimize negative effects and maximize positive effects. It involves reducing waste, conserving resources, and mitigating environmental impacts while preserving cultural heritage and benefiting local communities.Sustainability aims to drive growth for businesses that create jobs and promote travel, while maintaining a healthy environment that supports long-term human habitation and preserves our planet’s resources so that the thirst for exploration and travel continues.There are four pillars of Sustainability in my understanding:The question remains how do you drive all four of these?Making Technology a Driver for Sustainable TravelModern day technology – such as automation, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and smart analytics – can lead the future of sustainability in the travel and hospitality industry.Sustainable EconomyAI can help reduce the environmental impact of travel by providing insights into patterns and trends.By analyzing data on energy usage, water consumption, and waste production, AI can identify areas where sustainable practices can be implemented. This information can then be used to develop strategies to reduce carbon emissions and waste generation. For example, AI-powered energy management systems can optimize energy consumption in hotels and resorts, reducing their carbon footprint.AI can help improve resource management in the travel industry.By analyzing data on customer behavior, AI can predict future trends and patterns, allowing businesses to optimize their resource usage. For example, AI-powered demand forecasting systems can help airlines optimize their flight schedules, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions.IoT can measure and report the energy and water inefficiencies.By installing IoT sensors in guest rooms, common areas, and back-of-house operations, hotels can collect data on energy and water consumption, waste production, and carbon emissions. The collected data can then be analyzed to identify inefficiencies, develop sustainability targets, and monitor progress towards those targets. This data can also be used to inform guests of the environmental impact of their stay, and provide recommendations on how they can reduce their own carbon footprint.OTAs can have opt-out for towels, toiletries, plastics, etc.By partnering with OTAs, hotels can inform guests about these programs before they arrive, giving them the opportunity to opt-out of daily towel and linen service, as well as single-use plastics, such as straws, cups, and toiletries. This can reduce waste and water consumption, while also saving hotels on laundry and cleaning costs.Additionally, hotels can encourage guests to bring their own reusable water bottles and offer water refilling stations throughout the property to reduce plastic bottle waste. By partnering with OTAs to promote these sustainable practices, hotels can attract environmentally conscious guests who value sustainability and responsible travel.Content management on OTAs can communicate how customers can ensure that local communities and wildlife are not endangered.By incorporating sustainability messaging in their content management systems, OTAs can highlight hotels that are committed to sustainable tourism practices and inform guests about ways they can reduce their environmental impact during their stay. For instance, OTAs can provide information about local conservation efforts, responsible wildlife viewing, and sustainable transportation options. By providing accurate and up-to-date information, OTAs can help guests make informed decisions and support hotels that prioritize sustainability.AI can provide personalized, eco-friendly recommendations.By analyzing data on customer preferences and behaviors, AI can provide recommendations for sustainable travel options, such as eco-friendly accommodations and green transportation options.Creating More Value for EmployeesHotels can use technology to streamline operations and automate repetitive tasks, freeing up staff to focus on higher-value activities. This can lead to increased efficiency and productivity, which can result in the creation of new job roles within the hotel.Inclusive DevelopmentHotels can use technology to engage with and support local communities. For example, they can use social media platforms to promote local businesses and cultural experiences, or provide training and education opportunities for disadvantaged groups.Generative AI can teach communities to translate faster and communicate better.By utilizing Generative AI, hotels can create language translation systems that help employees and guests to overcome language barriers. With the use of real-time translation, employees can communicate with local communities more effectively, understand their customs and traditions, and provide better experiences for guests.Generative AI can be used to create educational materials that promote sustainable tourism practices.These include sustainable tourism practices such as how to reduce waste and conserve natural resources. By communicating sustainability efforts in the local language, hotels can ensure that the message is clearly understood, and the local community can participate in sustainability initiatives.Protection of IndividualsHotels can use technology to enhance guest safety and security. For example, they can use contactless check-in and check-out, digital room keys, and mobile apps to minimize face-to-face interactions and reduce the risk of infection. They can also use surveillance technology to monitor public areas and ensure guest safety.Hospitality Leaders Driving the ChangeMarina Bay Sands: Energy Management SystemMarina Bay Sands in Singapore has implemented an AI-powered energy management system that monitors energy consumption and identifies areas for optimization. The system uses machine learning to predict energy demand and adjust energy usage accordingly, reducing carbon emissions and energy costs.Marriott International: LEED Dynamic PlaqueThe Marriott International hotel chain has implemented an AI-powered tool called the “LEED Dynamic Plaque” in its properties across the APMEA and Americas regions.

This has helped the hotel reduce waste and improve recycling rates.The 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge: Smart Energy ManagementThe 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge in New York City uses a smart energy management system that utilizes AI to control energy consumption in the hotel. The system uses sensors and algorithms to optimize heating, cooling, and lighting in the hotel rooms, reducing energy consumption and costs.Citizen Hotel: Smart Irrigation SystemThe Citizen Hotel in Sacramento, California, has installed an AI-powered irrigation system that uses weather data to optimize watering schedules for the hotel’s landscaping. This system has helped the hotel reduce water consumption and costs.Hilton Hotels: LightStay ProgramHilton Hotels in the United States has implemented a LightStay program that promotes sustainable practices in its hospitality operations. The program uses AI to monitor energy usage, reduce waste, and promote sustainable practices among employees and guests. Additionally, the program provides guests with personalized recommendations for sustainable travel options.Radisson Blu Hotel: AI-Powered Energy ManagementThe Radisson Blu Hotel in Frankfurt, Germany, uses an AI-powered system to track energy usage and identify opportunities for improvement. The system provides real-time insights into energy consumption and helps the hotel reduce its carbon footprint.While some of the hospitality leaders have already started taking initiatives towards a smarter, more sustainable future, governments and the industry at large need to rethink their vision for sustainability.

65632799a3f6fc78b8eba170,1607846646,Here's Why You Should Care About Hotel Content Management & Distribution,"April 22, 2023","Today running a hotel is not limited to offering customers a place to stay. Your visitors expect delightful and differentiated experiences – which you can deliver through carefully curated content for your property.The modern travelers rely heavily on search. Reports suggest that about 700 million people will likely make online bookings by 2023.This is where you can leverage content optimization and distribution for hotels to improve your discoverability. From attractive attributes to a wide range of amenities, content plays a crucial role in telling your prospective customers everything about your property and driving more bookings consequently.Given the multifaceted benefits of content management and distribution for hotels, it’s essential to understand the importance of content and how it can significantly impact your hotel bookings and revenue.Table of ContentsHow Important is Content in the Post-Pandemic World?Before 2020, who could have thought that the world would essentially shut down, forcing everyone to stay at home. It’s no surprise that the hospitality industry faced a staggering impact – no more vacations, no more traveling, not even staycations.A lot has changed since the pandemic. These changes have made it even more significant for hotels to update their content with reliable, relevant, and updated information. The reason is pretty simple.Picture this: there’s a 30-year-old man, who has only known work and sleep for the last two years. He wakes up 10 minutes before his meeting, logs in, works hard the entire day, churning out as much quality work as he can. For entertainment, all he has is online streaming avenues.Now that the pandemic is somewhat fading, the wanderlust in him is reignited. He wants a quick getaway, a relaxing weekend at a hotel with a picturesque view. But more importantly, he wants to be in a safe and secure environment.Whether this business professional goes for a leisure vacation or work trip, the requirement for comfort and safety is likely not to change.Now, the question that you should reflect upon is – what kind of content will this traveler look for?Sure, it would be great to promote your hotel room that comes with a picturesque view from the balcony. But, it would be a lot better if you also showcase your hotel’s amenities, attributes along with COVID-19 safety and health protocols.As it is, the post-pandemic world is likely to see a renewed level of competition in the hospitality space. So to outsmart your competitors, it becomes imperative for you to update your hotel content with relevant attributes, amenities, and services to manage customer expectations.Are Demand Partners Able to Drive Bookings?Talking about demand partners, online travel agencies (OTAs) like Booking.com, Agoda, and Expedia come into mind. These OTAs and other demand partners such as GDSs, wholesalers, and bed banks usually showcase all the relevant content, both descriptive (amenities, attributes, policies and descriptions), and images, of a hotel and provide reliable platforms for driving hotel bookings.Images are the first thing that any potential customer looks for. Those create the first impression in their minds even before a guest steps in the hotel premises. So, a hotel generally uploads about 50 – 100 high-quality images to various demand partners.These images consist of both the exterior and interior shots of the hotel, like the lobby, bar, restaurant, hallways, etc., along with the guest room’s images.As a rule of thumb, try to include images that showcase more than only the bed and the living area. So, images of the rest room, toiletries, storage space, and room décor should be incorporated to ramp up the value proposition of your hotel(s).Another helpful step would be to tag all the images with relevant metatags, which increase your probability of ranking higher on search results and better categorization of images on demand partners.Next comes amenity and attribute information.It’s a crucial part of the listing that gives an overview of all that hotel has to offer. Most customers filter their hotel searches. Hence, it becomes essential to provide updated information about amenities to spring up in filtered searches.You also have to include hotel policies. Before customers book hotel rooms, they often look for hotel policies. This information majorly includes cancellation, check-in time, restrictions of pets, etc.Besides, due to COVID-19, OTAs now prefer the COVID-related information. So, hotels can specify their health and safety policies for customers’ safety.Benefits of Maintaining Content Parity Across Demand PartnersWith changing times, the average traveler’s expectations have shifted too. From seeking the basic hotel descriptions to requiring more niche and in-depth content, travelers’ needs have evolved.Good content will drive higher conversion rates and more satisfying guest experiences. Hence, keeping consistent, complete, and creative content across OTAs serves multiple benefits.Higher ConversionsWhen you update your content regularly and accurately, choose all the applicable attributes. It’s more likely that your listing will rank higher. A higher ranking will translate into an improved conversion rate. So, ensure that you update the content regularly. Keep checking whether your hotel is showing up with the filter criteria on demand partners. One missing key attribute can remove the hotel listing and impact your sales.Better VisibilityA hotel listing with few images or descriptions might fail to connect with customers. You want to attract guests, not make them scroll right past your listing.Build Up Genuine Expectation for Better ReviewsThe most crucial benefit of maintaining content is crafting genuine expectations for your guests. Today if you provide inaccurate information, it will result in massive disappointment for the customer and lead to negative reviews.Why is an Automation Tool Important?To deliver delightful guest experiences, prioritizing hotel content management and distribution is understandably important.\n\nNow imagine if there was a platform that could suggest which attributes are the most critical to drive conversions across all demand partners automatically.How Content-AI Makes Content Management & Distribution Quick and Easy?Hotel teams are most often grappling with less time, more work, and continuous pressure to deliver delightful guest experiences. In such scenarios, hotel content management and distribution slip ranks in the priority list.But imagine if you knew which content to exactly prioritize and update. What if the time-consuming task of updating content across all of your channels is done with a single click?Content-AI helps you with this.You can input all of your content and upload your photos on our cloud-based software. It will then distribute it to channels with a single click. Also, you can edit the content on Content-AI and push the updates to all of your connected demand channels from a single interface.So how does Content-AI work to make your hotel content management and distribution easier?Bid adios to the laborious task of manual content updates. Channel all your energy towards building the most incredible living experience at your hotel.Allow Content-AI to enhance the virtual presence of your hotel content on the desired demand partners, and drive more conversions.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-12868 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/xyz.png"" alt=""Content-AI work to make your hotel content management and distribution easier"" width=""1200"" height=""628"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/heres-why-you-should-care-about-hotel-content-management-distribution/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Content-Management-2-Why-Should-You-Care-About-Hotel-Content-Management-Distribution-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Content-Management-2-Why-Should-You-Care-About-Hotel-Content-Management-Distribution-scaled.webp,https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/xyz.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,Distribution,Hotel Content Management,,,,,,0

Let’s break it down into a few key areas.Table of Contents1. Setup and ImplementationOne of the first steps in using a booking engine is setting it up and integrating it with your website. This process should be straightforward and well-documented, with clear instructions and support available if needed. Look for a booking engine that offers a user-friendly setup process, perhaps with a wizard or guided installation. Ideally, you should be able to get up and running quickly without having to hire a developer or technical expert.2. User InterfaceThe user interface, or UI, is the visual aspect of the booking engine that your customers will interact with. A well-designed UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and minimal distractions. Look for a booking engine that offers a clean and modern interface, with simple and straightforward steps for customers to follow. If the UI is confusing or cluttered, it may lead to frustrated customers or abandoned bookings.3. Flexibility and CustomizationWhile ease of use is important, you also want a booking engine that can be customized to meet your specific needs. Look for a system that offers flexibility in terms of pricing, availability, and room types. Ideally, you should be able to easily adjust rates and availability, add or remove rooms, and set up packages or promotions. A booking engine that allows for customization can help you better tailor your offerings to your guests’ needs and preferences.4. Support and TrainingFinally, it’s important to consider the support and training that comes with your booking engine. Look for a provider that offers responsive and helpful customer support, whether it’s via email, phone, or live chat.

6563279da3f6fc78b8eba174,2122927489,Why is Security Critical for a Booking Engine?,"April 14, 2023","In today’s digital age, cybersecurity is a major concern for any online business. Hotels and other hospitality businesses are no exception. The hospitality industry has seen a surge in online bookings in recent years, and with the increase in bookings, the risk of security breaches has also increased. This is why it is crucial to ensure that your booking engine is secure and that your guests’ data is protected.So, why is security critical for your booking engine? Let’s take a closer look.Table of ContentsProtecting Your Guests’ DataThe most critical aspect of any booking engine is the protection of your guests’ data. A secure booking engine will protect your guests’ personal and financial information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals or hackers. This includes everything from their name and address to their credit card details.With the rise of cybercrime, protecting your guests’ data has never been more important. Data breaches can result in significant financial losses and damage to your reputation. Not only can they lead to legal action, but they can also cause your guests to lose trust in your business.Compliance with Industry StandardsThe hospitality industry has strict data protection laws and regulations that must be followed. This includes the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which outlines the security standards that all businesses that accept credit card payments must adhere to. Failure to comply with these standards can result in significant fines and legal action.A secure booking engine will be fully compliant with these standards, ensuring that your business is protected from legal action and financial penalties.Preventing Fraudulent BookingsFraudulent bookings can be a significant problem for hotels and other hospitality businesses. They can result in lost revenue, damage to your reputation, and even chargebacks. A secure booking engine can help prevent fraudulent bookings by using various fraud detection tools and techniques.These tools can help detect and prevent credit card fraud, chargebacks, and other fraudulent activities. This will not only protect your business from financial losses, but it will also help maintain the trust of your guests.Maintaining Your ReputationFinally, security is critical for maintaining your reputation. Guests expect their personal and financial information to be protected when booking online. A security breach can result in negative publicity and damage to your reputation. This can lead to a decrease in bookings and revenue, as guests may be hesitant to book with your business.By ensuring that your booking engine is secure, you can maintain the trust of your guests and protect your reputation in the long term.ConclusionIn conclusion, security is critical for any booking engine. It is essential to protect your guests’ data, comply with industry standards, prevent fraudulent bookings, and maintain your reputation. By choosing a secure booking engine and taking the necessary precautions, you can protect your business from the risks of cybercrime and maintain the trust of your guests.",https://rategain.com/blog/why-is-security-critical-for-a-booking-engine/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-is-Security-Critical-for-a-Hotel-Booking-Engine-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-is-Security-Critical-for-a-Hotel-Booking-Engine-scaled.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,Booking Engine,Distribution,Security,,,,,0
6563279ea3f6fc78b8eba176,540396471,Thank You Booking.com For Showing Us The Future,"April 13, 2023","For the last five years, travel has been all about sustainability, recovery, and – for the last few weeks – generative AI. And while all of these are highly relevant topics, there’s only one thing that ties them together – Diversity, and knowing that each person is different and is looking for unique and personalized experiences that cater to their individual needs and preferences.This is where, at the recently concluded Click. 2023 event, Booking.com showed us the future of travel and hospitality.Table of ContentsThe Changing Traveler and the Future of TravelThe 2023 Travel Predictions by Booking.com showcased at the event highlighted the importance of customization. And here’s how the hoteliers can leverage these trends to stay on top.1. 55% of the travelers are planning to spend their vacations off the grid.As most travelers are looking for off-grid style vacations to escape from reality in 2023, a rise in eco-friendly stays that embrace natural surroundings and sustainability is expected.For those hotels who have already been investing in sustainability, it is pivotal to make the guests aware about the same. They can do so by indicating the sustainability practices implemented on the extranet, which can then be displayed on their property page on booking.com as a part of its Travel Sustainable Programme.Read Also: How Green is your Hotel? Do Good and Show it to the World – on Google2. 42% of the travelers will focus on mental health and mindfulness.While highlighting wellness facilities that hotels currently offer – such as spas, gyms, etc. – is pivotal to drive growth for businesses, it is also important to partner with local businesses outside that provide additional wellness experiences. These additional experiences can then be offered to the guests.Hotels can also share information about local groups or attractions that might be relevant to certain niche groups – either pre-trip (window between the booking and the actual trip), or during the stay with the help of guest engagement solutions.3. 43% of the travelers will use virtual reality to find travel inspiration.Metaverse, and virtual or augmented reality offer people a new way to experience travel. While 43% of the global travelers claim that the technology will inspire their 2023 travel choices, 60% of the travelers still believe that such experiences are unlikely to replace in-person travel any time soon.Investing in high-quality images and extended reality content such as virtual property tours can make the hotel property stand out, and help potential guests imagine themselves in these properties. Thereby inspiring them to experience the stay in physical world as well.4. The future of travel and hospitality lies in understanding that each person is different.The bold & impressive stance around DE&I was truly the highlight of the event. At the event, Booking.com showed us that it is this diversity that makes travel so exciting and enriching.The tagline at the photo – “We filter places, not people.” – encapsulates the idea that diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the core of travel. It is through experiences that we get to know different people and cultures, and it is essential that we provide customized experiences that cater to the needs of different individuals and groups.Here are four tips for hoteliers who might not be already doing this:a. Show all your facilities that meet the accessibility requirementsHoteliers should highlight the accessibility features of their facilities and services, such as wheelchair ramps, bathroom grab bars, and designated parking spaces for those who may have mobility needs. They should also showcase their staff’s training to provide assistance to guests who require support and offer information on nearby accessible attractions and transportation options. This information can be prominently displayed on their website and promotional materials to ensure that all guests feel welcomed and valued.b. Make your content more gender-neutral and diverseIt is crucial for hoteliers to create content that is inclusive and welcoming to all guests, regardless of gender identity or expression. They can use gender-neutral language in their descriptions of amenities and services to make sure they don’t alienate guests with different gender identities. Hoteliers should also consider creating separate rooms or spaces for guests who don’t feel comfortable staying in traditional male or female accommodations.c. Show diversity through imagesHoteliers should showcase diversity in their promotional materials, including images of guests from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures. These images can be displayed on their website, social media accounts, and marketing materials to show potential guests that they are welcome and included in the hotel’s community. They can also highlight local cultural events and activities to encourage guests to explore and learn about the surrounding area’s diversity.d. Share information around local groups or attractions that might be relevant to certain niche groupsFor hotels that attract guests from different countries, it is important to provide information in multiple languages. This includes translating their website, brochures, and other marketing materials into languages that their potential guests speak. Hoteliers should also consider hiring multilingual staff to assist guests who don’t speak the local language. By providing these services, hoteliers can ensure that all guests feel comfortable and included during their stay.The Click. 2023 event by Booking.com was indeed an incredible experience that showed us the future of travel and hospitality. The onus is upon us to embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion in the travel industry, and deliver the perfect experience for every guest.About the AuthorMark Haywood\n\nSVP & General Manager – Europe and Africa\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/thank-you-booking-com-for-showing-us-the-future/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boooking-com-blog-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boooking-com-blog-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/travel-trends-at-click-2023.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/click-2023-photo-booth.jpeg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Diversity,Events,thought leadership,,,,,0
6563279fa3f6fc78b8eba178,-543056731,How to Evaluate a Booking Engine?,"April 13, 2023","As a hotelier, you understand the importance of having an efficient and user-friendly booking engine to manage your online reservations. With so many booking engine providers available in the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one for your hotel. Evaluating a booking engine requires careful consideration of several factors that can affect its overall performance and your hotel’s success.Here, we’ll discuss the key features and capabilities that you should consider when evaluating a booking engine.Table of Contents1. CustomizationThe first factor to consider when evaluating a booking engine is customization. Your booking engine should be able to blend seamlessly with your hotel website, and match the branding and design of your website. Look for a booking engine that offers customizable templates, fonts, colors, and graphics so that you can tailor it to your brand. In addition, it should also be mobile responsive to ensure that your guests can book from any device, including smartphones and tablets.2. User InterfaceA user-friendly interface is critical to ensuring that guests can easily book rooms on your hotel website. A good booking engine should be easy to use and navigate, with a clear and concise layout. Look for a booking engine that allows guests to check room availability, room rates, and room types quickly and easily. The booking process should also be simple and straightforward, with minimal clicks required to complete a reservation.3. IntegrationA booking engine that can integrate with your existing property management system (PMS) is essential for efficient management of your online reservations. Integration with your PMS allows for seamless syncing of room availability, rates, and guest information, saving you time and reducing the risk of overbooking or double-booking.

Payment GatewayA secure and reliable payment gateway is essential for processing online payments from guests. Look for a booking engine that supports a variety of payment options, including credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets. A booking engine that offers SSL encryption and secure payment processing can give guests peace of mind when booking with your hotel.5. Analytics and ReportingAn effective booking engine should provide you with detailed analytics and reporting, giving you insights into your online reservation performance. Look for a booking engine that provides data on occupancy rates, room demand, and average daily rates. This information can help you make informed decisions regarding your pricing and marketing strategies.6. Support and TrainingFinally, evaluate the support and training options that are available with the booking engine. Look for a provider that offers round-the-clock customer support, preferably through multiple channels such as email, phone, and live chat. In addition, make sure that the provider offers training and resources to help you get the most out of the booking engine.In conclusion, evaluating a booking engine requires careful consideration of several factors, including customization, user interface, integration, payment gateway, analytics and reporting, and support and training.

656327a4a3f6fc78b8eba17e,1736127779,What is Direct Booking?,"April 5, 2023","Direct booking refers to a reservation made directly with a service provider, such as a hotel or airline, without the involvement of a third-party booking agent or intermediary. This means that the customer contacts the service provider directly, either through their website, phone, or email, to make a reservation or purchase a product or service.Direct bookings are becoming increasingly popular as they often offer several advantages over bookings made through third-party agents. For example, direct bookings may come with lower prices, more flexible cancellation policies, and better customer service. Additionally, service providers can better track customer preferences and offer personalized recommendations when bookings are made directly with them.Direct booking trendsShift from GDS to MetasearchAccording to Adara’s (A RateGain Company) latest travel trends report we found something interesting.

656327a5a3f6fc78b8eba180,1417271856,The Relevance of Content for Hotels,"April 1, 2023","In today’s fast-paced world saturated with accommodation options for people to choose from, you have to go beyond the guest experience to maximize your occupancy rates and revenue.Presenting the right information about your property to attract customers is the key to unlock more bookings. Think of it as an easy way to tell potential guests everything your property can offer—be it food and recreation or amenities and local events/festivals.Now, you might wonder—why is hotel content so important?To answer it simply, people look for bookings online and do heavy research to finalize their stay options, with the global average lead time going up to 24 days. This is where hotel content acts as a virtual window to your property and facilities. So, let’s understand the different types of hotel content and how you can leverage each type to your advantage.Table of ContentsFundamental Types Of Hotel ContentHotels offer a wide range of services and the hotel listing should effectively present these services to maximize bookings. Let’s consider that you want to display details like location, amenities, hotel policies, and room types, among other things.Based on the nature of information, your listing content will fall under two categories:1. Static Hotel ContentStatic hotel content—as the name suggests—remains the same for a more extended period of time. It conveys details about fixed assets; such as property information and amenities.Static content includes a combination of textual and visual information. The descriptive content can cover details like property specifications, on-campus facilities, and recreational experiences.This category also includes photos and videos of your property. Images play a vital role in influencing customer decisions. It’s no surprise that hotel listings featuring high-quality images receive 63% more clicks than those with low-quality photos.2. Dynamic Hotel ContentDynamic hotel content includes constantly changing details, including room availability and rates. This is the kind of content hotel owners have to update at regular intervals. Dynamic content also includes details about pricing, which is bound to fluctuate with changing demand.Besides, you have to update your listing content to match guest expectations during peak demand seasons. For instance, during the ski season, this listing highlights the property’s distance from the nearest ski lift to offer guests the convenience of traveling.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-15592"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1.png"" alt="""" width=""1404"" height=""562"" srcset=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1.png 1404w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1-300x120.png 300w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1-1024x410.png 1024w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1-150x60.png 150w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1-768x307.png 768w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1-20x8.png 20w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1404px) 100vw, 1404px"" />Quality Content Connects with GuestsHotel content allows your property to rank for the right searchable filters. If guests filter for a beachfront property and your content mentions this tag, then you can gain better discoverability and potentially increase your bookings.Similarly, information about sustainability can also increase your booking rate. 57% of respondents in a survey by Booking.com claimed that they prefer staying in hotels with a sustainability certification. Another 47% mentioned that they filter their options to find sustainable properties.The same reason also applies to health and safety information. People are more cautious about the safety and sanitation protocols at any hotel and want to choose only the best options.By providing more specific information about such amenities can prove more convincing for your prospective customers. You can do this by adding new attributes in line with emerging trends and maximize interaction with your guests. Besides, you can also consider the parameters available at your demand partner to better optimize your content and create a standout listing.How Static Content is Becoming More DynamicGiven the changing guest expectations, it’s clear that static hotel content has become partially dynamic. What do you think was the trigger for this demand?In the post-pandemic world, customers expect up-to-date content that communicates the right information and convinces them to book a property. So, details about additional features like a safety or wellness icon, the current status of a hotel suite, and dynamic hotel images are more than just a nice-to-have. This content can boost your conversion rates.Besides, dynamic content offering timely details on various real-time events—like business conferences or festivals—can enhance customer satisfaction as well.How? These details allow your hotel guests to plan their itinerary in advance. It allows you to position your hotel as a responsible organization that emphasizes highly on customer experience. On top of that, you can also tap into greater demand during peak seasons by adding micro elements to your listing; such as telling the guests how far the hotel is from the Coachella venue.You can leverage property pages on various online portals to serve this purpose. These pages provide all the features to update dynamic content without hassle. As a result, you can deliver exceptional services to your hotel guests by virtue of content that informs.The Impact of Hotel ContentExample: Booking.comThe renowned online travel agency is a prime example of hotel content delivery. The content published on the property page plays a huge role in increasing the number of bookings. This hotel content delivery system rates your content in terms of a ‘property page score.’ Your hotel’s score on the extranet is directly proportional to bookings.Here are some insights from Booking.com’s property page:So, it’s clear that hotel content positively influences the conversion of guests and bookings generated. For this purpose, you should create content that meets these criteria:In essence, you need to understand the preferences of guests. Accordingly, introduce various attributes and optimize the existing content consistently. Such a process presents a greater chance to increase the bookings, thereby driving greater revenue.In a NutshellWe live in a world running on online research & information. Guests are proactive in researching and selecting a hotel that best fulfills their requirements.High-quality and up-to-date hotel content can help you match the changing demands of your guests. Understand changing preferences like the emphasis on health measures and introduce relevant dynamic content on your property page to maximize bookings.Besides, you can improve conversions and develop a unique brand reputation. With an AI-powered optimization tool like Content-AI, creating and updating hotel content is easy. The tool does all the heavy-lifting for you to update every property page in a few clicks and optimize your listings for maximum conversions.",https://rategain.com/blog/relevance-of-hotel-content/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Content-Management-1-What-is-the-Relevance-of-Content-for-Hotels-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Content-Management-1-What-is-the-Relevance-of-Content-for-Hotels-scaled.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture1.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,Hotel Content Management,,,,,,0

656327aea3f6fc78b8eba18a,-1230522413,The Data Goldmine: The 3 Step Process to Unlocking the Power of Guest Data,"February 15, 2023","Hotels have always run on watching for patterns among guest behaviors. It is how hotels strategize for growth. But with the rise of personalized guest journeys, the scale of data collection and analysis has reached new heights.  Data collection and analysis remains among the most under-utilized tools in the hotel industry. Hotels have long sought to understand the needs of their guests in order to provide the best possible service. These insights lie in untapped guest data. Using a blend of data analysis and consumer psychology can help provide that springboard into guest engagement and loyalty that hotels need. At the base of it, guest data is private, personally identifiable information that is related to the guest, all of it is crucial in helping hotels service guests better and sustainably over a long term. Table of ContentsStep 1: Data collection Accurate, well-defined data forms the most important foundation in seeking insights. Having someone to find data in every step of the guest journey is not only very labor intensive, it could also lead to inaccuracies in the data due to the repetitive and frustrating nature of the task. A good rule of thumb is to always collect data pre-arrival (about the guests’ preferences, that helps create a guest profile for every individual) and right before checkout (About their experience at the hotel, reviews etc)  The secret weapon that holds the power to unlock all these data points and more lies in technology. It helps glean in-depth insights from existing guest data. With the intervention of tech, guest data can be collected across the guest journey all the way from pre-arrival to post check-out. Automated data analysis systems can compile reports that provide a deeper understanding of the data collected and help identify trends and patterns that allow hoteliers to make better decisions. AI has made data collection extremely easy and secure. At every step of the guest journey, guest sentiments, their bookings, interest and footfalls can be tracked to not only add more data to the guest profile but also to provide individual data driven insights into the different parts of the hotel experience.  Step 2: Data analysis In order to find insights from specific areas of the guest journey, data needs to be segregated for effective analysis. Hotels must have the right tools in place to gleam actionable insights from the data. Otherwise, it’s just a collection of numbers and numbers alone won’t help hotels understand their guests better.  There are softwares that helps compile and sort through these data points to present graphs, compiled pointers and actionable insights with important numbers. These softwares can also be integrated with the hotel PMS itself to ensure smooth and seamless exchange of data.  One example of a data collection and analysis software is an AI chatbot that comes with a sentiment analysis tool. As the hotel staff and guest engage on the chat, the messages are automatically analysed and the sentiment analysis tool is able to attach a positive, negative or neutral emotion to every message. This data is collected throughout the guests’ stay and then analysed to show an overall negative or positive experience which lets hotels intervene in time to tip the scales towards positive experiences.  Step 3: Finding the right insights Now that the data has been compiled and analyzed, it’s time to derive actionable insight from it. Oftentimes, just one data point would not have the full story behind guest experiences. For example, finding out that revenue through the bar has suddenly seen a dip is only part of the full story. The next step is diagnosing the problem; Is it the location? Was there a personnel change? Is there a problem with the drinks or food?  Multiple data points need to be considered while finding insights. From the previous example, analysing reviews and guest sentiment around the keyword “bar” could help pinpoint the source of the issue.  What are the advantages to having the right data? Improves business:The success of any business has necessary KPIs which can not only be validated by data but it can also provide a deeper insight beyond the surface level of indicators.  Wondering where to invest to maximize guest satisfaction? Data has the answer. When considering what comes next, looking at the guest profiles and what they like will have the answer.Helps identify pain points: \n\nThe most significant use of data is in improving existing services. This data can also help understand how your guests use your facilities so that you can optimize your resources to better meet their needs. Check-ins could be taking too long, housekeeping might not be efficient or even something as small as reservation pages not working fast enough.Allows for a more personalized experience:In-depth data helps hotels gain insights into their guests’ preferences and behaviors. Keeping track of changing guest behaviors also becomes easier with a month to month comparison allowing for faster adoption of these changes.  Knowing that a guest is vegan can help craft their meals around their restrictions. Something as small as personalized welcome cards on their bed can vastly improve guest satisfaction.Improves upsellingHaving a guest profile with their likes and dislikes helps hotels upsell the right kind of services. For example, sending a message about spa services to someone who is a food connoisseur when a specialized tasting event is also happening. The mismatch between the data and the guest leads to reduced conversions. AI powered sentiment analysis combined with a guest profile that computers maintain for every guest can help identify the right guests to enjoy the right services.Helps hotels craft a guest journey perfect for their needsIn today’s highly competitive hotel industry, collecting and analyzing guest data allows you to gain valuable insights into how your guests interact with your hotel and can provide the necessary data points to make informed decisions about your hotel’s operations.  By understanding which segments are performing well and which are not, hotels can better adjust their services and strategies to meet the demands of their guests.Data treated right is the key to unlocking a lot of new possibilities and insights which ultimately builds businesses. For hoteliers, this helps better understand their guests, operations, and potential risks. It also allows them to tailor their services and experiences to their guests’ individual needs, helping to provide a higher quality of service and experience. By collecting and analyzing the right data, hotels can greatly improve their performance, increase their revenues, and provide a more enjoyable experience for their guests.

This allows hotels to provide a better overall experience for their guests and can help improve guest satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, guest messaging technology can help hotels save time and reduce the need for staff to handle routine inquiries, freeing them up to focus on other tasks.Profitability and brand loyalty depends on a hotel’s ability to understand and adapt to guests’ shifting behaviors.

656327b0a3f6fc78b8eba18e,2132621700,Spin Around the Challenges of an Economic Downturn with AI-Enabled Solutions,"January 30, 2023","With economic speculation rife and predictions suggesting a 98.1% chance of a global recession, it’s only natural that hotels experience particular challenges – be it attracting guests, increasing occupancy or ensuring that guests can enjoy a truly happy and worry-free escapade, away from the world’s uncertainties. The most recent times with a similar forecast were during the pandemic in 2020 and the financial crisis of 2008-2009, both of which had a tremendous impact on the travel and hospitality industries. So now, with the gift of hindsight, what difficulties can hotels look back at, as important lessons to navigate an economic downturn? What learnings and solutions can they implement that allow them to positively address guest sentiment, elevate experiences and offer a truly relaxing, luxurious holiday?    While the challenges are multi-faceted, the solution is simple. It’s about making things easier, faster, and less stressful. Which is why employing the advantages of technology is now particularly crucial for the hospitality sector to stay competitive and offer services that can meet the emotional and practical needs of their potential and visiting guests. Guest-facing tech is slated to become a $6 billion category, and it’s already revolutionised interactions, personalisation, convenience and operational efficiency. While it is difficult to determine the full extent of what this downturn will present, it is best to be prepared by developing strategies that reinforce a competitive edge, embrace technology and focus on tangible customer service.   Attract Guests, Against the Odds Naturally, the goal for every hotel from a business or strategic perspective is to increase brand value, occupancy rates and cost efficiency. This doesn’t change just because the economy is slow. Here is where AI can provide valuable insights into guest preferences and behaviours, enabling hotels to understand guest habits and preferences and create tailored experiences that make guests feel more valued and appreciated. In the current economic environment, this can also help optimise pricing strategies and increase occupancy rates. Personalisation yet LiberationWith technology, hotels can provide guests with personalised experiences tailored to individual needs yet free them from mundane hassles and long resolution times. This could include anything from providing welcome messages to suggesting specific activities or restaurants that they might enjoy. For example, AI-powered chatbots are able to quickly answer guests’ questions by utilising a database of answers and providing accurate, helpful responses in real-time – well before they even reach the hotel, with pre-arrival communication proving just as important a guest touchpoint as any in person.  This already helps put their mind at ease by clearing all doubts and building trust, so they come with a positive impression – which can be significant psychologically, in financially stagnant or precarious times. It is no surprise then, that a whopping 29.3% of travellers would prefer staying in a hotel that uses automated messaging or a chatbot service to provide guest support. Virtual Concierge services have also seen an increase in demand, which streamline and quicken processes like check-in, check-out, feedback and payments, among other services.  Beating the Competition to Profits AI upselling is also a powerful tool to help hotels during an economic downturn. For one, it can help target the most profitable target segments and leverage data from past purchases to identify who is more likely to make additional purchases. This can be used to create targeted campaigns that reach high-value guests to suggest upgrades or added services. It’s one of the surest ways for hotels to differentiate themselves from competitors. From the point of view of a guest who is willing to travel and invest in a holiday despite a stagnating economy, it’s these little things that make all the difference and offer measurable advantages across the operational chain.  It is clear as things stand that although a recession does bring a unique set of challenges, there are many potential solutions and opportunities that can be capitalised. With technology, hotels can provide guests with a world-class experience, no matter what’s going on in the world beyond the one they curate. That’s why it’s more important than ever to invest in AI-powered guest satisfaction and elevate your guests’ experience today.

656327b3a3f6fc78b8eba192,-173016061,Unlocking A New Level Of Luxury For Dubai: The Rising Need For Technology,"January 20, 2023","Dubai is at the vanguard of futuristic luxury. From its gleaming skyscrapers and iconic architecture to its world-class shopping and entertainment, it has long been a beacon of hospitality. The booming global hub attracts visitors from all over the world, for its sights, activities and incredible events. Whether it is Race Week at the Dubai Autodrome, the annual Dubai Shopping Festival, or a night at the Dubai Opera, there’s so much to explore and enjoy. But with high footfalls come high expectations and even higher pressures to surpass the guests’ as well as business’ demands. Currently, Dubai’s hotel industry has a promising forecast, and is proving to be a  destination that’s forever in peak. Revenue is expected to grow at an annual rate (CAGR 2022-2027) of 4.28%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$0.46 bn by 2027. Which is why Dubai’s hotels can no longer rely on simply delivering what guests expect. Rather, they must go beyond the ordinary with a one-of-a-kind experience that’s tailored to their guests’ unique idea of a luxe getaway, and truly elevate guest experience.But how do you do that without further burdening hotel staff and hotel budgets? That’s where technology comes in. Providing the ultimate service and experience by leveraging cutting-edge technology is the way to ensure the utmost satisfaction of guests, with an experience that surpasses the 5-star standards. Never Keep A Guest WaitingAt the forefront of the hotel industry, is guest experience. And AI-driven chatbots are set to revolutionise the way hotels interact with guests. Chatbots are a form of AI-enabled technology that allow guests to interact with a hotel’s services via natural language processing. This technology can help hotels provide more personalised services, such as virtual concierge services and more efficient response times, for any and every issue that may arise. Chatbots can provide an engaging, interactive and real-time experience for guests, allowing them to quickly and easily get the information they need. Think of all that time saved not having to wait at the reception, figuring out which number to dial for a particular service or being delayed for a flight at check-out, that can instead be spent exploring the city outside or travelling worry-free. Those are the little details that really take the guest experience to the next level and encourage revisits.Stand Out From The CompetitionArtificial Intelligence can revolutionise a hotel’s internal operations with data processing. You can have access to abundant data sources and quickly identify key insights in real-time that can be leveraged to drive growth in an over-crowded sector. Given that hoteliers can lose up to 10% of annual revenue by not responding to market fluctuations on time, with AI technology, managers are equipped to make informed, dynamic decisions that will help them stay ahead of the competition.Track And Plan For The DemandDubai is a destination that never has to worry about demand. But that doesn’t mean its hotels don’t have to. With a year-round influx of visitors for the destination’s infinite offerings, the need of the hour is for hotels to turn to AI solutions for demand forecasting that can predict dips and surges based on live data learnings across the many sectors of the travel industry, from flights to occupancy to car rentals. Equipped with this knowledge, hotels can curate and implement insightful strategies towards their advantage. Technology can be used to create an incredibly seamless workflow and immensely powerful analytics, allowing hotels to track trends, measure success and make strategic decisions with the power of data. When combined with the right personnel and processes, hoteliers in Dubai will be able to provide an even better guest experience, while saving time and money.So while Dubai is already a world-class travel destination, hotels and businesses have the potential to further enhance the experience and go beyond the usual. With a combination of luxury services and top of the line technology, each passing year will bring nothing but growth and new experiences for guests to Dubai.The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover.

656327b5a3f6fc78b8eba194,917463132,Troubleshooting Guest Engagement: Is the Answer in the Palm of your Hands? ,"January 6, 2023","Let’s go back to the basics: One of the most important parts of a hotel’s bottom line lies in the numbers of one detail. One thing that quite literally makes or breaks a hotel experience, one thing that defines the future of a hotel, one detail no hotelier can ignore: Guest engagement. While every hotelier has heard of it and is cognizant of its long lasting effects, most are struggling to boost these standards. Guest engagement is essential for any hotel. In fact, even one bad experience can lead to a guest abandoning the hotel altogether.  There are multiple aspects to a great guest engagement strategy: In order to create a memorable guest engagement journey, it is important to have a well designed strategy in place, supported by quality execution. Every step of the guest journey needs to be pre-planned to ensure maximum engagement with minimal hassles. Technology has become so integral to our lives that it’s hard to imagine a day without it. And with good reason: It’s a tool that can help us simplify our lives and connect with others. But what about hotels? While technology can be a great way to connect with guests, it can also be a distraction. And when a guest is distracted, they’re less likely to stay in the hotel. That’s where engagement strategies come in. Engagement strategies are designed to keep guests connected to the hotel and their experience there. And the best way to do that is with technology. Table of ContentsWhat are the Hurdles Hotels Need to Cross? Hurdle 1: Lack of labor Hospitality has traditionally been rooted in human to human contact. But with the recent changes in the industry, there is a shift in the way hospitality is being defined. (Want to read more about that? Check out this blog on digital hospitality) This is especially important due to the rising labor shortages. As the number of staff goes down, the amount of work per person goes up. This results in staff being unable to fully engage and actively work on improving guest engagement because they’re often caught up (if not burnt out) to fully take on the range of guest engagement functions. From the UK to Thailand, shortage of skilled workers is a major cause of concern. In fact, in a survey by the American Hotel & Lodging Association, a whopping 97% of 500 hotels reported staffing shortages. Hurdle 2: A transformative shift in guest needs Among the other things the pandemic has transformed, guest needs and expectations are probably the most significant for hoteliers. Guests have collectively moved towards a minimal contact, maximum efficiency way of life. There is an expectation on all service providers like hotels to be equipped to deal with minimal phone calls, minimal guest-hotel staff interactions and maximum optimisation to ensure rapid turnaround times. This shift in guest behavior has resulted in hotels needing to adapt immediately, or risk losing guests. Hurdle 3: Lack of strategy Quite possibly the most difficult hurdle to jump over, adding the right strategy to every step of the guest journey is key to building the best possible guest engagement. What this means is an analysis of guest behaviors, hotel services, the staff competencies and more need to be taken into account in creating a guest journey that maximizes guest engagement with minimal hassles for both guest and hotel.  Defining a great guest engagement strategy is not a one solution fits all situation. But a solution that is seeing a rapid rise is AI. Solutions with technology are all the more popular due to its inescapable nature. So What can Technology do? Removing hurdle 1: Lack of labor In helping with the staff shortage, the purpose of the technology is two-fold. On one hand, the automation of repetitive tasks helps free up some of the time for the staff. The other aspect is the ease of assigning tasks through smart management tools, simplified communication tools  and compiled analytics to ensure the right numbers.  Through virtual check-in solutions, automated FAQs, automatic upselling solutions and more, technology eases the pressure and optimizes productivity. This also makes it easier to keep guests well reminded of what is happening at the property. This can be done through regular updates on guests’ preferred chat platforms. If done well, these reminders will help to keep guests connected to the property and increase their chances of returning. Removing hurdle 2: A transformative shift in guest needs 6.6 billion people own a smartphone, a tool that cannot be ignored in crafting guest engagement. One of the most significant aspects of the pandemic was the role of technology in maintaining connections during lockdown. This has transferred into the post-pandemic world as contactless has taken priority. Partly due to the effects of the pandemic, this is also driven by the ease of life with tech-integrations. The shortened turn around times, omnipresent nature of technology accessible through smartphones and reduced effort for the guest to engage with the hotel are just a few of the reasons technology is a perfect solution. Removing hurdle 3: Lack of strategy A well planned engagement strategy is key to ensuring that guests stay connected and excited about their stay. This involves considering both the short and long term goals of the property. For example, if a hotel is trying to boost customer retention, it may want to focus on creating a unique guest engagement experience that is different from other properties in the area. Alternatively, if a hotel is looking to boost sales during busy periods, it may want to focus on reminding guests about deals and discounts available. Finally, it is important to make sure that guests are reminded about the property’s amenities and services. This can be done through regular updates, social media campaigns, or special notifications in the hotel lobby. If done well, these reminders will help to keep guests connected to the property and increase their chances of returning. According to a recent study by Hotel Technology, 73% of guests surveyed are likely to return to a hotel that meets their technology needs, highlighting the significance of technology in guest satisfaction. As they say, the future is now. Especially for the hotel industry. An unimaginable slew of changes has taken the hotel industry by storm. But the ones to survive this storm are hotels that adapt to technology based solutions. The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover. It has huge potential but is underpenetrated.Engage-AI is RateGain’s Virtual Assistant Conversational AI platform which helps optimize your hotel’s operations, create upsell opportunities and generate more revenue per guest, ultimately enhancing guest experience and increasing satisfaction scores for the hotel.For an in-depth guide on Engage-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with our experts “here”",https://rategain.com/blog/troubleshooting-guest-engagement/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MicrosoftTeams-image-6.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MicrosoftTeams-image-6.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Chatbots,Engage Ai,guest experience,guest messaging app,,,,0
656327b6a3f6fc78b8eba196,-1668997313,No Shortage of Guest Engagement Despite Labour Shortage in the UK: Why Technology is the Answer,"December 23, 2022","The UK has been all over the news for quite a while. But the UK has been making rounds even on hospitality news because of one problem: A staff shortage so bad, hotels have to resort to shutting down a few hours or few days a week.Hoteliers are no strangers to the difficulties of finding, training and retaining staff. With the pressure to make hospitality experiences enjoyable and memorable, the labour shortage can cause serious issues. Especially since traveller volumes have been rising consistently, it’s now high time to find solutions to this pervasive problem.The problem is affecting many areas of the hospitality industry, ranging from the front of house staff to the back of house staff. Front of house staff are particularly affected, as they are the face of the hospitality business and their roles are essential in providing a warm and welcoming service to guests. This shortage is already having an impact on guest satisfaction, as hotels are struggling to provide the same level of service that they did previously. Not to mention the lack of personalization whether it be in terms of entertaining guests in their native language or giving every guest a memorable experience through customisation based on guest preferences.The exact origin of this problem is hard to pinpoint. But some studies show that the UK hotel industry has been under-staffed since 2006. Adding to one, the high turnover rate (as high as 30% in 2019) has further contributed to worsening the problem. As of recent time, the pandemic and Brexit have made the situation especially dire.How is this affecting the situation on ground?What’s the solution?There is a need for a multi-pronged approach here from different sources. But an immediate solution that not only alleviates many of these problems but also upgrades the quality of guest experience lies in technology.Technology can play an important role in helping to fill the gaps in staffing in the hospitality industry. By utilizing existing technologies, hotels can ensure that guests have a seamless, enjoyable experience.Automation is becoming increasingly commonplace in the hospitality industry, with many hotels and restaurants now relying on software and robots to carry out tasks that would previously have been done by staff.

656327b9a3f6fc78b8eba198,355084401,Journey to better guest satisfaction: Why digitisation is the shortcut you need,"December 16, 2022","As hotels are on the path of improving guest satisfaction, several solutions have come to light. The unique challenges presented by an industry as dynamic and varied as the hotel industry require multiple interventions. In order to maximize productivity and guest satisfaction, hotels need to solve a multitude of problems. But what if there was one solution to all these problems?The journey to a thousand great guest experiences can start with one simple step: digital integration. The technology revolution has given hotels new ways to meet the changing needs of their guests. The pandemic acted as a catalyst for what now seem like basic offerings for any hotel to offer: contactless experiences, and thus the adoption of contactless experiences throughout the guest stay.From the very first point of contact: Pre-arrival, AI can start adapting to guest needs and use this data to provide a more personalized experience. From the very beginning, hotels can provide guests with 24/7 support, and they have a solution in the backend that is consistently collecting data, optimizing communication, and ensuring guest satisfaction.To fully illustrate the extent and impact of technology in hotels, it’s first important to understand what the best possible experience is and why it works.<img decoding=""async"" class=""size-full wp-image-20406 aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Top-arrow.png"" alt="""" width=""22"" height=""38"" srcset=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Top-arrow.png 44w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Top-arrow-12x20.png 12w"" sizes=""(max-width: 22px) 100vw, 22px"" /><img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-20405"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1-300x75.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1000"" height=""251"" srcset=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1-300x75.jpg 300w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1-1024x257.jpg 1024w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1-150x38.jpg 150w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1-768x193.jpg 768w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1-20x5.jpg 20w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" /><img decoding=""async"" class=""size-full wp-image-20408 aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bottom-Arrrow.png"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""33"" srcset=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bottom-Arrrow.png 119w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bottom-Arrrow-20x11.png 20w"" sizes=""(max-width: 60px) 100vw, 60px"" />\n\nPre-arrival\n\nOpen the channel of communication by sending a message saying thank you for the reservation and to inform guests of the various services the hotel offers, down to a meal upgrade when they check in.How it helps: It allows hotels to prepare for guest expectations and meet them with the added benefit of upselling.The first piece of communicable real estate that hotels can capitalize on, pre-arrivals are often left unused.

The longer it takes, the more guest frustration builds. After a long time spent in transit, tired and carrying luggage, guest frustration will only get worse with delays from the hotel. Thus creating a terrible first impression. However, virtual check-ins provide the answer.How it helps: It reduces wait times, makes it easier for the guest and thus, creates the right impressionThe solution is virtual check-ins that can be fully automated by having AI collect all the necessary data beforehand to avoid creating long queues at the front office.

656327baa3f6fc78b8eba19a,1464616611,7 Tips for A Booking-friendly Hotel Website,"December 12, 2022","A high-booking website is crucial for the success of your hotel. Based on seven criteria, we show you what makes a hotel website successful!A user-friendly website with a high number of bookings is essential for the success of your hotel. Within 2.6 seconds, visitors get a first impression of your website and decide whether to stay or look around at the competitors. Based on seven criteria, we show you what is essential for a successful hotel website!Table of ContentsTip #1: Intuitive page captureFirst impressions count. Create a harmonious overall impression with nice pictures and a friendly and uniform colour scheme. Focus on your USPs and show what makes your hotel different from others.Potential guests want to know why it is worthwhile to choose your hotel over all the others. And last but not least – ensure clarity and comprehensibility. The guest should be able to get an overview of the relevant information immediately after opening the page.Tip #2: Booking optionsThe main purpose of your website is to generate bookings. So make sure that the user has enough opportunities to do so. Your booking button, including the arrival and departure dates, should be visible and available to the user at any time to complete a booking. Ideally, you should adapt the button to the style of your site and let it slide while scrolling so that guests always have the chance to book at your hotel.Tip #3: ContentUse qualified content to give guests a preview of their stay in your hotel. Therefore, choose especially professional, actual and expressive pictures which already create a feel-good atmosphere in the guest’s mind.Provide additional helpful content in the form of short text paragraphs with suitable subheadings so that guests stay longer on your website and find information about your hotel. If you offer different language versions, make sure the translations are of good quality.Offer extra benefits. By including guest reviews on your website, your readers can get a better impression of their stay in your hotel and build trust. You can also provide travel information so that visitors can plan their journey and, if necessary, calculate travel routes.Tip #4: NavigationGuide the users straight through your website. To help potential guests find information, you should pay attention to a meaningful navigation bar and functional navigation to simplify the orientation on your website. In addition, integrate the booking engine into the navigation in a visible way – this will\n\noffer potential guests a quick and uncomplicated booking option.Tip #5: Call-to-ActionsNo matter if it’s for newsletter subscriptions, table reservations or last but not least, the booking button – Call-to-Actions are essential on hotel websites. They must be eye-catching and clearly visible. Nevertheless, they should be serious and well-positioned. When implementing them, ensure they are uniformly presented to maintain a harmonious overall picture.Tip #6: TechnologyThe loading speed is a crucial aspect for the success of your hotel website. Only a few seconds can be decisive in determining if a potential customer even becomes a visitor to your website or not. If it takes longer than 4 seconds to load, the visitor jumps off and does not return. Even with fast-loading websites, a slight slowdown can have a massive impact on the bounce rate, as a study by the Internet service provider Pingdom showed. For example, the bounce rate was 9% with a loading time of 2 seconds – but if the loading time increased to 3 to 5 seconds, the bounce rate also increased to 38%, which means that essential bookings can be lost, especially on hotel websites.Therefore, use tools to measure speed (for example, Google Speed Test) and reduce your bounce rate.Additional tip: The faster the loading time, the more beneficial it is for the ranking in the search engines.Tip #7: MobileAnyone who still needs to adapt their hotel website for mobile devices has already lost. More and more travellers use smartphones or tablets to search for hotels. Also, the first impression counts here – if your website does not adapt to different screen sizes, the traveller will switch off and switch to your competitors.So make sure your web design is mobile-friendly, that the booking button is fixed, images and text are easy to recognise, and that navigation is easy to use.Improve the user experience of your hotel website and turn website visitors into guests!Myhotelshop, a RateGain company, provides solutions to increase direct sales of hotels and make it a profitable distribution channel by optimizing, managing and distributing hotel content and campaigns to demand partners and driving the online success of its hotel partners.For more information, visit Myhotelshop or book a demo with our experts here.",https://rategain.com/blog/tips-for-a-booking-friendly-hotel-website/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/7-tips-for-a-booking-friendly-hotel-website-blog-banner.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/7-tips-for-a-booking-friendly-hotel-website-blog-banner.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Hotel,Online bookings,,,,,,0
656327bca3f6fc78b8eba19c,-1174934060,The Problem In Paradise: What The Hotels Of Maldives Need To Know,"December 6, 2022","Sandy beaches, sun shining down, the quiet lull of the ocean and the gorgeous Instagrammable resorts are just a few of the reasons Maldives is a bucket list spot for travelers world over. But is it all sunshine and beaches for the hoteliers? The one island, one resort policy has yielded excellent profits, but there are several issues to address as well.The well-deserved reputation for Maldives as THE spot for luxury tourism and business getaways has caused a major boom in travel, especially post pandemic. In the last 50 years, Maldives’ tourism and hospitality industry has contributed to more than 22.3% of the country’s GDP and about one-third of the government’s revenue.This status as one of the most sought-after tourist spots has also brought about a range of operational challenges that only seem to get worse with the increasing number of guests. These challenges are not only affecting the hospitality business but also hampering the guest experience.Table of ContentsWhat are the speed bumps in Maldives’ fast growth?Hiring and retaining staffIn a hotel, particularly luxury ones, the staff plays an extremely important role in crafting guest experiences. From lower-skilled to specialist roles, the entire team needs to run like a well-oiled machine. However, finding the right skills and experience can be an arduous task, especially in Maldives with its overwhelming pressure and unique travel challenges. When the right people cannot be found or retained, the remaining members often face burnout and stress, leading to further chaos and disharmony. The pressure is further intensified from the intense rise in the number of travelers in 2022.Matching the needs of a modern travelerIn order to secure great ratings as well as guest loyalty, travel needs to be marketed as an entire experience. The secret is to be adaptable to the shifting needs of the guest and develop a personalised experience. The likelihood that guests will stay and remain loyal drops as the number of touchpoints decrease. Guests are now looking for hotels that can accommodate their technological needs and thus make it a more seamless experience. In fact, 73% of guests are likely to return to a hotel that meets their technology needs (such as digital check-ins, instant messaging options and so on).Wasted resources on providing updatesCommunication is slowed down to a large extent for two reasons:Staff is often responsible for informing guests of events and updates, which is labour intensive as they have to individually alert every guest. Not only does this add extra pressure to the staff, it also causes the hotel to lose out on much needed manpower and causes guests to miss out on any events of their interest. This can also reduce event participation due to lost messages.A sluggish pace of check-inGuests often spend a lot of time sitting idle as they travel from the airport to their respective destinations: Time that could be put to much better use. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to many hours in an archipelago like Maldives. That’s especially a reason seamless check-ins become crucial: Guests are already fatigued by the time they enter the hotel. A sluggish check-in can add to the growing frustration.Rising to the challengesFirst, it is essential to understand that all industries are becoming increasingly complex.

656327bda3f6fc78b8eba19e,1942315353,The Good Side Of AI: Read Between The Lines To Understand Your Guests’ Feelings,"November 11, 2022","BREAKING NEWS: AI can now track human emotions!Is this the robot uprising we should be worried about? Not at all! In fact, this is great news for hoteliers. At the core of sentiment mapping is AI tracking guest’s emotions throughout their stay by analyzing their message exchanges to the hotel.Lying in the hands of guests’s sentiments is full control over reviews, satisfaction and ancillary revenue. The hotel industry is constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of its guests. In recent years, there has been a shift towards using sentiment mapping as a way to gauge guest satisfaction. Sentiment mapping is the use of  natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to identify and store information on the different states of guest sentiments. This data can be used to improve the guest experience by identifying areas of opportunity and making changes accordingly.Table of ContentsFirst of all, what is it?What this AI powered solution does is to very literally, as the name suggests, map out the sentiment of an entire guest base, or to target specific groups of people (for example those who have recently stayed at a specified hotel). To do this, hotels need to collect guest feedback and use it to create a “sentiment map.” Every text is analyzed to give it a neutral, bad or good rating. For example:SourceWhat does sentiment mapping do for you A deeper measure of guest satisfactionProviding the best possible experience for their guests is of paramount importance to every hotel leader. Thus hotels need to be aware of the guest sentiment around their hotel. What might not be obvious to the eye can be revealed in these reports. Sentiment analysis moves past the surface level understanding of 1 star or 5 stars and takes a further look into satisfaction at different touchpoints.The problem with reviews is that they provide an overall idea: An average one mostly. While averages work very well for certain industries, hotels are more human based and as a result, more insight driven. And so averages are dangerous.For example, if 3 guests reported happy, neutral and sad as their experience on the satisfactory behavior of the staff, all hotel leaders would see it as a neutral average experience. That is, the issue of the one bad experience or the performance of the good experience is not even counted. Like they say, the devil is in the details (Or in this case, the answer to the hotel’s growth is in the details) As executives look at these experiences with a closer eye, they will be able to glean insights and learn to better the hotel experience.Proactively identify potential problemsThe common consensus on the idea of sentiment mapping, especially among hotel leaders, is the idea that they don’t need to worry about sentiment mapping because they already have a good reputation. However, even the most well-regarded hotels can have unhappy guests, and it’s important to be aware of what those guests are saying. Additionally, sentiment mapping can help identify potential problems before they become a full-blown crisis.This becomes especially important when you look at the cost it is taking on the hotel to get new guests. Harvard Business Review found that it can cost businesses between 5 to 25 times more to acquire a new hotel customer than retain a current one. But, a Phocuswright study found that 84% of TripAdvisor users agree that an appropriate management response to a bad review “improves my impression of the hotel.” So when you get a negative review, responding appropriately would immediately assuage any doubts the guest has about the competency of the hotel.In fact, there’s a cognitive bias called the peak end rule that comes into effect here. The peak end rule states that intense positive or negative moments (the “peaks”) and the final moments of an experience (the “end”) are heavily weighted in our mental calculus. That is, they form the majority of our thoughts about an experience. Thus it becomes important to lower the negative peaks and end on a good note.Sentiment mapping can help identify guests with an overall negative experience and give the hotel a chance to fix it before they check out in the form of discounts, promotions or intervention by the staff. Once these problems reach a boiling point, it would be a lot harder to alleviate the negative experience. That’s the key to improving and keeping up a great hotel.Identify opportunities for upsellingBy understanding what guests are looking for, hotels can offer additional services that will appeal to them. Boosting ancillary revenue and bringing in better reviews, this can help identify key moments and nip any negative affect guests might have in the bud.  The faster an issue is resolved with a negative remark, the more likely the guest is to have an improved impression of the hotel.While upselling might already be a part of a smart hotel, sentiment mapping would allow hoteliers to find the right audience for each service, mitigate negative affect (through promotions, offers etc), and boost conversions by sending the right message at the right time.To illustrate this idea, take the example of a guest who was disappointed by a dirty room when they arrived. Sensing the negative words in the message, the AI can be programmed to automatically trigger a custom response redirecting the guests to enjoy the special Asian themed buffet the hotel is having for the week with a celebrity chef while their room is put back in order. Not only does it improve the chances of the guest trying out the buffet meal, it also reduces the negative feeling the guest has towards the hotel. This could also be done with promotional deals to allow these messages to maximize the impact of these upselling messages.Identify trends in guest behaviorTracking the right data points and analyzing the results on a regular basis can help identify insights which are valuable in predicting, optimizing and even introducing new services to the hotel.At the core of a human service industry like hotels, is the insight behind every problem, solution and great experience can be used to uplift guest satisfaction. Not only does it improve all aspects of the hotel business, it also makes it easier to analyze these sentiments with a curated report.Digging deeper into sentiment analysis gives hotels the human insight behind guest problems and experiences which are great learnings for the hotel as a whole. This information can help hotels make the right marketing campaigns and create the right set of offers to reach the target audience.The hotel industry is one of the most competitive industries in the world. Sentiment mapping is a valuable tool that hoteliers can use to improve their business. By understanding how guests feel about their stay, hotels can make necessary changes to improve the guest experience. Additionally, sentiment mapping can also help hotels identify new sales opportunities and understand trends in guest behavior.AI is not simply about automating repetitive tasks. It’s about adding features which otherwise would not be possible due to the limits of being human. AI has allowed hospitality to expand its reach and drastically improve guest experiences, now all that’s left is for hotels to catch on. Will yours be one of them?The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover. It has huge potential but is underpenetrated.Engage-AI is RateGain’s Virtual Assistant Conversational AI platform which helps optimize your hotel’s operations, create upsell opportunities and generate more revenue per guest, ultimately enhancing guest experience and increasing satisfaction scores for the hotel.For an in-depth guide on Engage-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with our experts “here”",https://rategain.com/blog/ai-to-understand-guest-feelings/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sentiment-mapping-1-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sentiment-mapping-1-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/engage-ai-banners-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Chatbots,Engage Ai,guest experience,guest messaging app,,,,0

656327c2a3f6fc78b8eba1a2,625075784,Digital Hospitality: No Longer An Oxymoron,"November 3, 2022","What comes to your mind when we say hospitality? Front office? Service? Human touch? Personal connections? At the core of the idea of hospitality lies the idea of making it human. But what if we told you that adding AI and tech to hospitality is, in fact, making it more human?Digital hospitality provides a way to personalize experiences with the help of AI at a level that staff would not be able to. For example, instant messaging software allows every message to be answered in real time with the added touch of addressing each guest by their name and even their own language! That is the core of digital hospitality: A way to make a personal impression without diminishing human contact. As we move into a digital first world, the definition of hospitality has changed and is still evolving. Tech is becoming an important part of hospitality, especially post-COVID. So what is digital hospitality? It is an umbrella term to describe the range of IT applications in the hospitality industry. That’s it. Wait, isn’t it just a fad?No! In fact, the smart hospitality market size is expected to grow from USD 13.6 billion in 2022 to USD 49.9 billion by 2027, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29.8% during the forecast period. AI is providing innovative solutions to the many challenges faced by the hotel industry. Not only is tech solving problems, it’s also providing a way to elevate experiences while helping the hotel at every step. What this means is that the right mixture of tech support and human intervention is currently redefining hotel experiences for every guest, every hotelier. As tech is becoming a major part of hospitality, learning about digital hospitality as a hotel leader becomes of prime importance. SourceA seismic shift is underway as travelers are coming back, economies are improving, and travel has become a major part of post-COVID life.Here are a few essential elements that digital hospitality can provide:\n\nAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Table of ContentsWhy digital hospitality should be next for your hotelEase of useNot only are guests able to simplify a wide range of hotel procedures throughout their stay, but the staff are also able to lighten their workload by automating certain repetitive tasks. Certain softwares allow for instant messaging on channels like WhatsApp, WeChat etc., which makes it extremely easy to use for the guests who keep their phones on them at all times. Nearly 30 percent of travelers said that they are “very interested” in staying at a hotel that uses automated messaging for most customer service requests, driven by the idea that it’s much easier to find help through text and chat than track down a person who can assist.Improved revenueUpselling software proactively reaches out to guests to promote ancillary services. At every stage of the guest journey, capture the guests’ attention and advertise services at the right time, the right way. Starting even before they check-in, guests will be able to get information about room upgrades, available services, and more. One major hotelier that leveraged predictive analytics and customer profiles to personalize promotions boosted consumer acceptance rates by 300% in one year.System integration servicesSome processes, like virtual check-in, can be automated to avoid repetitive tasks for the operations team. PMS and supporting booking softwares are automatically updated as rooms are reserved to ensure that guests making direct reservations see the latest information on availability. Revenue managers use hotel automation to make sure that real-time changes are appropriately represented in the property’s CRM, revenue, inventory, and sales systems rather than manually tracking and inputting data from one system to another.Helps the hotel own a guest’s journey, even outside the hotelA hotel is no longer just a place to stay in foreign countries, it’s an experience. As competition has gone up, so has the need to become a more personal part of a guest’s life. Establishing a rapport in and out of the hotel has become an important need. AI could be the solution, keeping in touch with their journey outside of the hotel by wishing them on birthdays, sending promotions and more.PersonalizationAI provides a level of personalisation to every guest that wouldn’t be otherwise possible. Every message can be customized to their native language, interests, names, and many more details, which can prove extremely essential in crafting a great experience. Personalization plays into two key psychological factors: Desire for control and information overload.The benefits of digital hospitality cannot be ignored anymore as more and more hotel leaders are adapting and actively using them to better guest experiences. In fact, over one-third (34.4 percent) of hotel leaders said they are already heavily invested, with another 26.6 percent in early stages. Only 3.7 percent said they do not plan to invest in this technology. Clearly, smart hospitality is coming to the center stage. The spotlight is now on hotels that are quick to adapt to these sweeping changes. What do you think? Is your hotel adapting to the digital wave?The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover. It has huge potential but is underpenetrated.Engage-AI is RateGain’s Virtual Assistant Conversational AI platform which helps optimize your hotel’s operations, create upsell opportunities and generate more revenue per guest, ultimately enhancing guest experience and increasing satisfaction scores for the hotel.For an in-depth guide on Engage-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with our experts “here”",https://rategain.com/blog/digital-hospitality-no-longer-an-oxymoron/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Digital-Hosp_Banner-1-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Digital-Hosp_Banner-1-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Graph_Banner-02-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Blog,,,,,,,,,,0
656327c3a3f6fc78b8eba1a4,-572749271,Peak Experience For The Peak Season,"October 27, 2022","“Hello, West End hotel, Reservations. How may I help you?”Hi, I wanted to book 2 of your deluxe rooms from the 15th to the 21st of November.“Sure, ma’am. Let me check that for you right away…\n\nI’m sorry ma’am. As I can see here, we’re completely booked out all of that week, including the week before and after! May I note down your details to add you to our waitlist? We currently have 14 guests on the list.”How did that make you feel as a hotelier?Excited at the prospect of new guests, more money, and better business? Or did you immediately dread the chaos about to ensue? Most hoteliers are probably feeling a mix of both as they think about peak travel season right around the corner. Whatever the feeling, this period is the money maker that no hotel should compromise on. Optimizing the guests’ experience is of paramount importance during these times.The peak season for multiple places like India, UAE countries, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Egypt, Maldives, Bahrain, Qatar etc is either here or coming soon. All the more reason to make this peak season your best one yet!Peak season is not just key to cater to existing guests, but is in reality a long term opportunity to initiate guests into loyalists that keep returning. Not only that, people are willing to spend more on travel and build more memories. This is a great chance to upsell services and reach a larger customer base.Table of ContentsThe problems of peak season are well documentedOverwhelmed staffGlobal tourism has reached 415 million tourists worldwide in 2021. It is expected to grow even further in the coming years. “Great news!” hoteliers might think, but labor shortages might be the wrench in business plans hotels aren’t ready for. In fact, half of former hospitality workers said that they wouldn’t return to their previous job in the industry, according to a survey. The staff that is there would be overwhelmed with guests that not only brings down employee morale but also causes the employees to be less receptive and react less quickly to guest demands.Delayed responsesWith multiple people calling one front office for all their questions, responses are bound to be delayed. If there’s one thing we know, it’s that nobody wants to wait.Read more: How serious delayed responses can be for your hotelLack of personalisationTourists are no longer looking just for fancy accommodations and meals, they are looking to be travelers. They expect to engage with the culture of the locals, and they place immense value on these experiences. But when hotels are unable to take the guests on this journey, they are less likely to engage with you again. Personalisation of each guest’s experience poses a serious challenge during peak season. As the number of guest-hotel touchpoints goes down, so does the hotel’s ability to make a personal impression and boost guest engagement.Check-in and check-out issuesCheck-in and check-out can become extremely tedious as more tired tourists come into the hotel. Long queues can quickly make a great hotel seem terrible. People also tend to perceive uncertain wait times to be longer and can cause significant anxiety and anger to tourists who are excited to start their day in a new place.Ask and ye shall receive: The solutions you needAs digital hospitality is slowly trickling into the world with AI-powered tools, hotels have the opportunity to re-look their internal systems and upgrade them for a smoother peak season.Hotels must invest in technology, especially ones that can take on automated tasks to relieve the workload on employees.Provide support to the staffAcross four studies, researchers have found happiness makes people around 12% more productive. This number has varied across multiple studies, but one thing remains common, happier employees are more productive.Many automatable processes can be taken up by AI-powered tools. Collecting documents or payments, upselling and many more processes can now be fully done without human intervention. This helps the operations team operate better.Automate responses to save timeWaiting is the enemy of a good hotel experience. That’s why AI can easily respond to queries in real time whenever the guest needs it. Not only does this help the front office deal with a lower volume of questions, it also improves guest satisfaction with instant response times on platforms they are comfortable using.Improve guest engagement and personalizationProactive communication is the key to unlocking the best guest engagement. In fact, 70% of people prefer brands that proactively engage with them. What this means is constantly staying in touch with a guest through multiple touchpoints and being accessible at every point in the guest journey. This helps hotels build a better relationship with the plethora of new guests coming into the hotel, thus improving the chances of a repeat stay.Ensure smoother check-in and check-outsVirtual check-ins and check-outs are the way of the future. An increasing number of guests expect it of most hotels because of how hassle free it can be. Millennials and Gen Z are actively looking at mobile first communication to make it simpler and less time consuming. 53.7% of hotels say that mobile first technology is a part of their business plan for the next few years.Peak season is the perfect opportunity for every hotel to put forward their best foot. Hotels must optimize these processes to ensure that the new guests become a permanent part of their base.That’s our take, what’s yours?The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover.

656327c6a3f6fc78b8eba1a8,-1271335510,Guest Dissatisfaction: De-mystified,"October 19, 2022","Since the start of the first hotel in the early biblical times, guest dissatisfaction has been a concern hoteliers have been carrying. Centuries have passed by and it is still a highly misunderstood concept by many. Guest dissatisfaction is largely due to delayed services, not the services themselves. Keep reading to see how.The average daily rate for branded hotels has risen 34.8% overall. But hotel guest satisfaction has declined 8 points (on a 1,000-point scale) from 2021, driven primarily by dissatisfaction with cost and fees and guest rooms.Guest dissatisfaction is often misconstrued to be centered around bad service. But in most hotels, guest dissatisfaction has little to do with the hotel’s services themselves. Guests are, more often than not, unhappy about delays in providing these services.Having guests line up for 20 minutes to check in? Making them wait 10 minutes for a simple question? Delaying spa appointments because of poor planning? Forgotten promotional offers that weren’t pushed to the guests? All of these factors contribute to guest dissatisfaction and a negative review of the hotel.The rising prices and labor shortages have affected the guests just as much as the hotels themselves. Hotels are trying to get back on steady financial footing but holding off on upgrades after the pandemic. Thus, prices are higher, but the raised prices do not reflect improved guest services.<img decoding=""async"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lowering-Guest-Satisfaction.jpg"" width=""100%"" />\n\nSource: ASCI Travel ReportTable of ContentsHow do we resolve this?Timely intervention when the guests need it is all it takes to drastically improve their satisfaction. Optimizing processes for better satisfaction has been a challenge for hoteliers everywhere, especially due to the labor shortage in the industry. However, the intervention of technology in hospitality in the form of chatbots and AI-assisted tools has helped solve this problem to a large extent. Furthermore, a growing tech-savvy millennial and Gen Z guest base has made hotels realize that the way to keep up in the increasingly competitive market is to efficiently integrate technology.A study conducted by researchers at MIT found that people who experience long wait times are less likely to be satisfied with the overall experience, regardless of the quality of the service they receive.The study found that customers who had to wait longer than 10 minutes for service were significantly less likely to return to the business or recommend it to others. In addition, those who experienced long wait times were also more likely to leave negative reviews online.Real time assistance: the real winner70% of the guests want to use technology to speed up service time. AI chatbots have allowed guests to ask and get automated responses 24/7. Hotels can now offer guests virtual concierges who will track their sentiment and warn the hotel in advance in case of negative experiences. The front office can focus on providing quality care to every guest while repetitive tasks like answering FAQs can be automated. These responses can be automatically customized into multiple languages to help establish another layer of rapport between the guest and the hotel.Help guests find what they need, and also what they don’t know they need!Guests, especially tourists, might have questions about the destination or need services that the hotel can readily provide. The travel assistant or front desk might not always have time to effectively juggle these frequent questions. If all this information was available readily at the click of a button, guests wouldn’t need to wait and the hotel staff wouldn’t be further burdened. This not only helps nudge guests in the direction of ancillary hotel services, thus boosting revenue, but also frees up the hotel staff from mundane tasks and focus instead on amping up their service quality.Extend guest touchpoints to more than just the front deskBeing in touch with the guest at multiple points establishes a rapport and makes the hotel a lot more approachable. What this means is that guests have a constant backup that they can trust to provide information, solve problems, and be more of a friend than a hotel that isn’t consistently reachable. This improves customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and helps guests improve their overall experience without having to jump through hoops.Guest dissatisfaction, at least in the way it’s currently understood, needs to change. It is only through reducing response and resolution times across various touchpoints that guest satisfaction can be accurately measured and improved. Bettering guest experiences using technology results in increased revenue. Thus becoming the way of the future, which looks to be a bright one!The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover. It has huge potential but is underpenetrated.Engage-AI is RateGain’s Virtual Assistant Conversational AI platform which helps optimize your hotel’s operations, create upsell opportunities and generate more revenue per guest, ultimately enhancing guest experience and increasing satisfaction scores for the hotel.For an in-depth guide on Engage-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with our experts “here”",https://rategain.com/blog/guest-dissatisfaction-de-mystified/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Guest-Dissatisfaction.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Guest-Dissatisfaction.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lowering-Guest-Satisfaction.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Chatbots,Engage Ai,guest experience,guest messaging app,,,,0
656327c9a3f6fc78b8eba1aa,-575645815,Beyond Just Emojis: Leveraging WhatsApp To Improve Guest Experience,"October 11, 2022","Launched in 2009, WhatsApp was initially conceptualized as a way to update people on a person’s status. Like “Battery low” or “On a call”. But as time has ticked on, WhatsApp has evolved from just updates to becoming an industry leader, revolutionizing digital communication worldwide, enabling not only personal connections but also offering hotels an avenue to effortlessly integrate into their guests’ daily lives – if done smartly.It is natural to be cautious of using WhatsApp to engage with hotel guests, given that it’s a very personal space. But a good rule of thumb is to only carry on the conversation beyond the first outgoing message once the guest responds. A response indicates that they are open to communicating through WhatsApp.With 2 billion people using WhatsApp every month to communicate with loved ones, friends, colleagues, and, as of recent, brandsThis has become an important tool for the hospitality industry. Add to this, WhatsApp launching a B2B initiative, and this platform should be in every hospitality leader’s business plans.Table of Contents4 ways WhatsApp enhances guest experiences for hotelsBefore deep diving into how hotels can use WhatsApp, it’s important to understand just how far reaching the act of using this simple tool can be.The real life implications: Touchpoints WhatsApp can reachIntegrating WhatsApp isn’t just about confirming their check-in times or bills.

656327caa3f6fc78b8eba1ac,-307826169,Experiences Above All:  The Long and Short of Guest Experiences,"October 6, 2022","25,000 stories are being told about the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel every single day. Out of the 75,000 guests who check in every day, 34% tell their friends. What are they doing to create these conversations? Turns out the answer is providing guests with a warm chocolate chip cookie whenever they check-in.Why do people love it? This cookie helps guests feel welcome and special creating a positive first impression that gives a great start to the hotel experience. One of the reasons this is such a successful gesture is that experiences are very vivid and when it’s memorable, stories will be told about them. Stories that only come out with exceptional guest experiences.While stories and experiences form one way of boosting footfall, vouchers and offers are another age-old tactics. Vouchers have been the tried and tested move to gain more customers but their demerits are often overlooked. Once vouchers become a part of a hotel’s strategy, people tend to expect more vouchers and are less likely to come back to pay the full price. This not only brings down the image of the hotel but also has the potential to hamper business.  Vouchers act as a one-time incentive in comparison to experiences that last a lifetime. It’s important to remember vouchers can only be a short-term way to boost numbers. But at the end of the day, all that counts is how many come back for more.Table of ContentsWhat can better guest experiences do?The oldest trick in the advertising book is one that still stands to be one of the most effective forms in today’s world: Word of mouth advertising. 88% of people had the highest level of trust in a brand when a friend or family member recommended it. In addition to that, out of the top five popular ways to recommend a business, word-of-mouth comes first, followed by Facebook, Google, and Twitter.Word of mouth is largely based on the concept of social learning. It has become an important tool for humans to not only survive but to also pick out what is the best among a range of experiences. Social learning essentially posits that one way of picking up new behaviors is by interacting and observing the people around us. However, the only way to convince people that a business is any good is to provide them with the best experience they can have.As leaders in hotel operations, it is important to note that this means that one of the best marketing investments a hotel could make is in its guests. Guest experiences are what matter at every guest touchpoint: From check-in to check-out. Whether it be reducing wait times during check-ins with a virtual check-in or hotel support in planning their overall stay or even just communicating in a language the guest is most comfortable in, it’s always the small things that make the biggest impact.On the flip side, it’s important to remember the big impact negative experiences can have on guests. The negativity bias comes into play here. Our brains seem to be hardwired to more readily respond and remember negative than positive experiences. So one negative moment can severely affect the guest’s perception of the entire hotel experience, however positive. In fact, it takes 12 positive customer experiences to make up for one negative experience.Every guest touchpoint is a way to create a memorable experience that could become the story they tell everyone. One of the most cost-effective ways this has come about is through the development of tech and AI. Here are a few simple ways to make guest experiences betterCheck-ins must be as fast and as efficientThe first impression a hotel makes is its front office and check-in process. Long waits and an overwhelmed front office employee is not what guests want to see after a long flight. Substantial research has affirmed the importance of first impressions which even in the face of opposing facts, continues to affect how people perceive the rest of the experience. Avoid long wait times for queries 90% of customers rate an “immediate” response as essential or very important when they have a customer service question. Keeping customers waiting when they call the front office for basic FAQs can negatively affect their perception of the hotel. Ensure quick response times whether it be by automation or through appointing dedicated staff.Easy access to all hotel services Help guests find what they are looking for whether it be a spa or a guide through the city to show them that you are going above and beyond for their comfort. Not only does the guest get all their needs satisfied within the hotel, they would also be able to truly appreciate the full set of services that the hotel can provide.Quality guest experience checksKeep in touch with their experience to correct any problems and help them out in case of issues within the hotel. Having an open line of communication between the hotel and guests ensures that the guest can get any issues immediately solved keeping them happy. Any problems that the guest might face wouldn’t seem as bad if the hotel is able to respond as soon as possible.What does this boil down to?Quality experiences should be the long-term plan for every hotel to flourish. Ultimately, vouchers are a way to get people into the door but what makes them stay is the wonderful experience laid out for them. More importantly, that’s what makes them recommend the hotel to more people. No vouchers can bring people back after a bad experience.It is important to note that vouchers might not be for every brand or every type of consumer as they reduce the perceived value of the hotel, especially for luxury hotels. A great experience leaves people with a positive effect on the brand and thus not only creates repeat customers but also makes it more likely that they will recommend the hotel to more people.At the end of the day, a business is only as good as the customer’s experience. That should be the first focus for hotels to attract more customers. Creating experiences has now become much more cost-effective and easy to execute with rapidly developing technology and software.As leaders in the hotel industry, it’s important to focus on creating memorable experiences, for each and every guest, much like the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel case.The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover.

656327cca3f6fc78b8eba1ae,785747468,Humans Of RateGain: Q&A With Mark Haywood,"October 4, 2022","Mark Haywood—Senior Vice President & General Manager (Europe), RateGain—got candid with the team, and talked about his time at RateGain, the organization, and the industry. Check out what he has to say.Table of Contents1) How long you have been working for RateGain?I’ve been with the company for just over three years now and am based out of our European hub in Barcelona. I’ve been in the hospitality industry for just over 2 decades, having spent the last 11 years in the technology side of the business and the prior block of time being a hotelier across various departments & functions.2) What is the vision that drives you forward every day?Over the years I think I’ve actually had many mottos which inspire me & have been commonly used by me, hence they sometimes annoy those around me in parallel (laughing). I’ve been with a “own the change” mantra for the last few years though – this is probably brought on by some of what was happening in the industry and hearing many peers across companies saying they wanted things to come back differently or to pivot and I genuinely believe that people shouldn’t wait for change to come but be part of the change when they see something which needs enhancing etc. One of my favorite mantras, from quite a few years back, was “just do it” but with hindsight I can see why “own the change” is a lot better for relationships! I truly am in love with this industry and my driving force is being part of its evolution!3) In your role as General Manager, how do you motivate the people that you work with?I am a believer in team work, am not such a hierarchical person. & feel giving people space to take decisions plus be heard is important. I like to have a structure, so things don’t fall through the net or rely on a one-man show, but genuinely prefer working through projects, ideas & issues together rather than simply telling people what to do or inflict my own ways of working on people. Obviously, everyone is different though and some people need both extra (& less) attention than others – so finding the balance is often a critical game which needs to be played. Encouraging open communication across teams and organizations is key to truly keeping up to speed, plus obviously recommending people “own the change!” when they see or feel something needs to be done differently.4) How much does the office culture impact the team feeling and collaboration?We had a long time away from being in an office environment together, due to COVID etc., and obviously this had an impact on our return to the office planning too. We made a big effort to maintain culture & social interactions during the “work from home” era but there truly is no comparison between being able to chat casually over coffee or lunch with colleagues to dialing into a very “planned” online social gathering. I definitely was happy to see that the largest percentage of team in Barcelona were pushing to get back into the office vs wanting to stay at home too. We still have a social calendar of planned events to celebrate together, and which focus on growing culture, but I see that this is now organically evolving with each month that passes based on being together and being able to collaborate easier – the number of scheduled TEAMS & Zoom meetings has dropped heavily since we moved back to the office and this is something which I know that I am not the only one to be thrilled about. The new office has been designed to encourage collaboration between teams and includes multiple “sofa & informal” areas to enable this to grow.5) How do you think RateGain differentiates itself from our competitors?RateGain is in quite a unique situation whereby we work with a 360 degree area of the travel & hospitality industry, whereas many of the companies who are in our space work with just one part of the industry, for example some travel tech companies work with “just hotels” or “only with airlines” etc. but we work across the hospitality & travel verticals, and this wider area of coverage gives us very strong insights into what is truly happening in our client markets, taking into consideration many more factors. The lines of business within RateGain, distribution, business intelligence & digital services, are also all very heavily interlinked for clients and allow us to not only advise someone of what is happening, with business intelligence, but also help them take actions against the knowledge, via distribution or digital services.6) What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the hospitality industry?The hospitality industry has gone through some tough times in recent years, I don’t think anyone can argue with that, but the worst of it is now behind us. There are some very key topics which are playing out in the industry currently too, including staff shortages, inflation on operating expenses, and a business mix change from corporate to leisure guests for certain markets. The need for hoteliers to pivot and be flexible in their offerings is deeper now than at any other time in my career previously. I would always recommend keeping up to date with new technology, i.e. moving away from some of the legacy systems which have less integrations, looking deeper at partners who can give you automization around cause & affect, reviewing a wider channel mix than previously in play for certain markets, ensuring that effort is made to drive & reward direct clients, and enhancing guest engagement methods. The industry has innovated heavily in the last couple of years and I know will continue to do so – so I can’t say enough how important it is for people to keep up to date on what solutions exist both with their current vendors and generally who exist in the market now vs. a few years back.",https://rategain.com/blog/humans-of-rategain-mark-haywood/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rategain-Partnership.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rategain-Partnership.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Blog,,,employees,Humans of RateGain,Life at RateGain,,,,,0

Landlines ringing all around. Front office staff trying to apologize for the delay. And it’s only the start of a new shift.Sounds familiar? If this is what your front desk looks like, something must be done. But to fix the problem, it’s important to first understand where it all started: The year that shall not be named. The pandemic dramatically changed the way humans have worked for centuries in the span of a few months. The hotel industry is no exception.With contactless check-ins to multiple sanitizations throughout the day, guests have come to expect a certain level of hygiene and precautions from the places they visit. Whether it be having to wait in lines with many other people or having the elevators sanitized, guests are choosing to be safe. Hotels that don’t follow these protocols are at risk of severely affecting their reviews and their business.One of the first places where the hotel makes its impression on how seriously they take the health of their guests is the front office. Long queues filled with guests resulting in increased odds for any kind of virus transmission? 0 stars. Waiting by the front office and touching multiple surfaces to have to check-in? 0 stars. Contactless check-in to only pick up sanitized keys from the front office? 5 stars.A hospitality business’ beacon of hope in these demanding times lies in innovative technological solutions designed to keep up with fast-changing times. Let’s dive into a deeper look of what are problem areas that are faced by the front desk and how it affects guest experience.Table of ContentsWhat are the problems?Staff that is overworked and underappreciatedThe hotel and motel industry reports experiencing an employee turnover rate of 73.8%.<img decoding=""async"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/employee-turnover-rate.png"" width=""100%"" />This is mainly triggered due to the working conditions, high job demands with low pay, work timings, relationship with the superiors, lack of recognition, and unhealthy work environment. Add to that, the strain of the pandemic, many employees have left the industry triggering a terrible labour shortage.Lack of systematic cohesion between guest and hotelWith the industry now scrambling, hotels have less help and more guests to serve. Without a structured communication between the guests and the hotels, there has been a significant drop in guest satisfaction. This ultimately leads to hotels losing a major part of its revenue and loyal guests.Out of sync guest management systemsMost hotels haven’t upgraded from their old management systems. With ever-growing technology, it is vital to stay updated.A recent study by OpenMarket said that 90% of guests in the US and UK preferred communicating via text with the hotel.As hotel leaders, it’s important to keep abreast of this channel of communication to better customer experiences.As these problems have arisen, so have the solutionsAutomate responses to reduce the loadTechology advancements have allowed the development of conversational AI and chatbots for the hospitality industry. Automated FAQs can be programmed so guests can get an instant answer as soon as they send a text. This allows personnel to use more of their time on creating better experiences and optimizing their productivity.Create a one stop system for all hotel informationPutting together all the different hotel services and numbers in one place so guests can access whatever they need when they need it without needing employee intervention. A virtual system which can anticipate the guest’s needs to provide them with the best experience possible. This way, the guest can easily navigate the different services offered at the hotel and the hotel will be able to upsell these services to the right people.Update management systemsIt is no secret that every organization has its own systems in place. While making everything universal and standardized is certainly not the required outlook, being grounded and set in orthodox methods does not help either. Front desk operations throughout the globe need smart devices and open-source-friendly systems. Adaptability is key to being ahead of the competition in this fast-paced environment. Front office will then be able to reduce time spent in outdated activities and focus on what really matters: The guest.The Way ForwardAs we step into the post pandemic world, optimizing workflow in the front office will boost customer satisfaction as well as help cope with the loss of employees. Boost productivity in the front desk with the aid of technology designed to enhance guest stays and remove any barriers between the guest and the hotel.Since we live in a digital era, giving guests the digital space to engage with the hotel is essential and productive. Not only does this translate to better service but also opens up opportunities to reduce costs, therefore increasing revenue.The hospitality industry is quickly seeing an upturn mainly due to the return of normalcy in the world. People have taken up traveling and going places much like before, however, their need for safety and concern for their health has also taken precedence. Therefore, the onus is on the industry leaders to create an ecosystem of great experiences coupled with ease of access and enjoyable service at all times. The answer lies in innovative technology solutions that save time as well as boost revenue.The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover. It has a huge potential but is underpenetrated.Engage-AI is RateGain’s Virtual Assistant Conversational AI platform which helps optimize your hotel’s operations, create upsell opportunities and generate more revenue per guest, ultimately enhancing guest experience and increasing satisfaction scores for the hotel.For an in-depth guide on Engage-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with our experts “here”",https://rategain.com/blog/productivity-for-the-front-desk-what-has-changed/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Productivity-For-The-Front-Desk-What-Has-Changed.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Productivity-For-The-Front-Desk-What-Has-Changed.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/employee-turnover-rate.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Chatbots,Engage Ai,,,,,,0
656327d0a3f6fc78b8eba1b4,795860661,How Can Scoring Content Help Hotels Drive More Bookings,"September 20, 2022","We all understand the importance of content in today’s digital world. It is what helps us establish a better understanding of the product and then make more informed decisions. As the world came out of the pandemic, guests became more aware about hotel amenities and policies — as volatility forced a lot of travelers to have flexible plans.General property information, photographs, room features, and available amenities — anything that informs a customer about an establishment must be included in static content. That material is the single most crucial factor in driving bookings.Now, listing channels have different systems to assess the content. In an ideal world, you’d evaluate which channel brings in the most conversions and update the information accordingly. However, that’s not always possible.So, this article will highlight the critical factors in generally updating and prioritizing content to drive more bookings. That will enable you to improve global conversion rates and better understand what works and what doesn’t.Read on to know more.Table of ContentsThe ABCs of high-scoring hotel content<img width=""939"" height=""504"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-ABCs-of-high-scoring-hotel-content.png"" alt=""The ABCs of high-scoring hotel content"" />\n\nSourceStatic hotel content has become vast now due to constantly evolving customer demands. Somebody wants a pool; another guest may desire a dedicated bar at the lounge. Simply making these additions to an establishment isn’t enough. You also have to advertise them.OTAs assume the same. These platforms want details such as:Omitting such crucial information from your listing will make a potential customer assume that your establishment isn’t up to par. At this point, it doesn’t matter if you offer the facilities they want. You’ve already lost them.Consider this example. In a 2021 survey, 70% of hoteliers wanted to eliminate traditional guest handbooks and digitize hotel information. Why do you think that is?The answer is pretty straightforward. Comprehensive online information on an OTA is more easily consumed.Quick tips to improve your content score<img width=""941"" height=""564"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1.-Quick-tips-to-improve-your-content-score.png"" alt=""Quick tips to improve your content score"" />\n\nSourceWhile each OTA might treat and prioritize content for hotels differently. They include:The key is in the details. The more quality information you put out there, the better your hotel content score will get. That will directly drive conversion rates.Technology and automation can make all of this easyNow that you grasp the importance of a content, you also need to realize that it may not always be easy.\n\nMost of that difficulty comes from the lack of automation in the process. Operational teams manually update static material or focus primarily on one listing channel. It also doesn’t help that management teams relay feedback on the broader content through a convoluted processes.\n\n<img width=""939"" height=""422"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Technology-and-automation-can-make-all-of-this-easy.png"" alt=""Technology and automation can make all of this easy"" />\n\nSourceHotels can solve this by incorporating optimization platforms such as Content-AI to circumvent such challenges. One simple click and the application will update property information across all platforms simultaneously.What else can it do?All of that adds up to one thing—a higher property score. And, as implied before, a better score means more bookings.Content checklist to improve property rankings<img width=""966"" height=""556"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Content-checklist-to-improve-property-rankings.png"" alt=""Content checklist to improve property rankings"" />\n\nSourceYou have a broad idea of what to work towards now. Still, what exactly do you need to improve your hotel content score?The correct approach lies in being as detailed as possible. This applies to your property overview, room information, categories, etc. Essentially, it’d be wise for you to elaborate on anything you can. So, here are some things to check off that list.A perfect captionOften, OTA merely display your property caption. That means a potential customer has to go solely off the property name. They won’t see anything else.\n\nSo, consider adding a by-line that describes what your hotel is all about. What are the attractions nearby? What do you offer that other places don’t? Anything that helps differentiate you from the rest works here.Be as creative and unique as you want. That’ll only help grab more eyeballs.Straightforward room codesOptimization tools like Content-AI enable you to structure room information comprehensively. The idea is simple. Assign a code to a listed room. Then, any associated picture or information gets the same designation.That streamlines customer experience, helping them browse better. The simpler the code, the better it is for bookings. For instance, say you offer two penthouse suites. You could assign something along the lines of ‘PS-01’ to the first suite and follow the same idea for the second.A prominent factor influencing customer engagement is the idea of conveying expertise. What you need to realize is that expertise doesn’t necessarily mean jargonistic terms. The more straightforward you make things, the more engagement you get.The proper tags and categoriesSearch engines rely on your tags to filter online results. So, if you haven’t tagged or categorized your content appropriately, it will be excluded from the displayed establishments.This goes deeper than people may realize. Merely listing a category as ‘guest rooms’ will not work. You need to provide better information. What kind of guest room is it? Is it a deluxe suite, a honeymoon suite, or specifically meant for corporate figures?In short, categorize room information and then offer sub-categories. That will help improve the general hotel content score while streamlining the search process for channel visitors.Curated and descriptive contentSome listing channels display more than the caption and may offer a brief overview of the property and the available facilities.Your listings need to take advantage of such opportunities. Don’t consider anything to be irrelevant. Do you host a karaoke bar? Great, put that in there! Does your hotel offer pan-Asian cuisine? Even better!Ensure that you leave nothing out. Remember, hotels sell an experience  before anything else. So, even minor details can make someone choose your establishment over another option.Wrapping upParticular platforms offer some general guidance to help improve your overall hotel content score. However, it’d be best for you to learn how to identify the vital assessment areas independently.All of the information in this article can be captured in one mantra: The more details you offer, the better engagement you receive. Include pictures in your listings, and you’ll notice a higher conversion rate. Highlight some recently added facilities and more guests book rooms to use them.The world has moved on from basic demands. What people considered a luxury yesterday is a necessity today. So, your focus should be on getting the highest score possible. In doing so, you invariably draw attention to your property.And, if this wasn’t already established, the more attention you get, the better it is for you.",https://rategain.com/blog/how-can-scoring-content-help-hotels-drive-more-bookings/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Drive-more-bookings.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Drive-more-bookings.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-ABCs-of-high-scoring-hotel-content.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1.-Quick-tips-to-improve-your-content-score.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Technology-and-automation-can-make-all-of-this-easy.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Content-checklist-to-improve-property-rankings.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,,,,,,,,0
656327d1a3f6fc78b8eba1b6,-1592602991,New Data Sources To Help Commercial Teams Make Better Decisions,"September 20, 2022","Hotel revenue managers and commercial teams rely on data increasingly amidst increasing volatility to make better decisions that can help in generating revenue. The need for data continues to evolve and increase as we focus on the digital first guest and their ever evolving needs.Meaningful data has many advantages for hoteliers. For starters, they can understand what’s working for them and what isn’t to improve their guest experience, boost customer loyalty, predict trends, and, most importantly, increase their bottom line.In fact, data collection and analytics have become a top priority for hotel owners, especially since the pandemic. But can the utilisation of new data sources yield significant revenue for you?Table of ContentsHow To Make More Out Of Guest FeedbackCustomer data can be a goldmine for hoteliers to tailor their processes and better match guest expectations. For instance, when a booking is made, you receive the visitors’ details. Then sending them a survey can give you a clearer idea of their preferences.That said, simple data about the customer—which only includes the amount of time that they have stayed at the hotel—is no longer enough. On top of these basic details, you also need to know their likes, plans, and overall purpose. You can do this in two ways:By understanding their personal preferences and interests, you might understand if they can be a regular guest or someone enjoying a one-off trip. For example, if they are on a business trip, chances are that they could become a recurring customer for your hotel.So, how does this help? By collecting this data over a period of time, you will be able to identify cohorts and develop a marketing and content strategy that speaks to each individual guest about ‘why’ they should book with your hotel improving conversions.Updating this content on your website, OTAs and social media will ensure consistency of experience, meet guest expectations and increase guest lifetime value.A recurring guest not only reduces your cost of guest acquisition by becoming a repeat customer, but also spreads the positive word of mouth on important channels further increasing conversions.But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Data collection can provide even better ways to boost revenue.Paid Digital Marketing Strategies that Drive Higher ROASGuest Feedback to identify cohorts allows you to send targeted emails, personalize experiences and engage with them for longer. But most commercial teams, struggle with the question — how do we know when to engage.Inflation and cost of living increase has continued to impact margins in the hospitality and service industry — which depends on manual labor to deliver the experience at the hotel. Therefore, in the event of increasing costs, any service-based industry starts squeezing its marketing and sales budgets.However, commercial teams are already struggling with volatile demand and with the added burden of lower budgets. They need data source that can help them deliver better results. This is where understanding inbound travel demand to a specific location over the next 90 days.This helps you not only understand when to initiate campaigns but also when to start communicating more frequently via emails as guests are more likely to respond to communications when they are closer to finalizing their travel plans.Helping hotels understand when and when not to run their campaigns, helps save crucial marketing dollars as well as drive better returns.How is it made possibleAll of these sources of data help the hotelier improve their marketing campaigns.Understanding Local Events and Competitors BetterAs the pandemic raged on, the biggest competition to hotels was not only the virus but also short term rentals and stand-alone hotels in nearby locations, that people could drive to for a weekend and during the pandemic, a lot of hotels — irrespective of their size — competed for the same market in the recovery phase.However, after the pandemic, it becomes crucial for the hotel industry to adapt according to consumer behavior. It is a known fact that customers will return to a hotel that provides them with the utmost comfort. Often, this comfort is related to the general attitude of the hotel towards the customer, along with the services offered.Now, this is where numerous hotels tend to make mistakes. For example, the price for average accommodation in New York for a standard double room increased from USD 222 in May 2021 to a whooping USD 375 in May 2022. To put it into perspective, this was a 69% increase in the span of a year!However, with volatility and ever evolving global politics, these rates can change any time of the day and tracking such events in your local area is critical. Any new event or new promotion started by any player can impact daily bookings.Understanding How Travelers Make DecisionsApart from understanding factors that impact demand, and where the demand is coming from – another important factor or data source for hoteliers is in understanding which content attributes, policies and information convince travelers to book a hotel on OTAs. This is critical to reduce the cart abandonment rate and improve conversions.Travelers are looking to invest up to 50% of their income in travel and hence are specific about the experience they can expect at the property – and therefore, getting insight on what are the most critical content attributes will help hoteliers prioritize in updating that content over OTAs and on their websiteSumming UpWith the market constantly evolving, it is necessary for hoteliers to adapt rapidly. The landscape is changing, and indeed, it could be a cause for panic. However, keeping track of the market movements and adjusting your hotel experience accordingly will always help you stay one step ahead of other hoteliers.It is all the more reason to increase your reliance on data. Numerous other industries have started making data-driven decisions to make better product adjustments and allow a steady stream of gains to flow. After all, data is an essential tool that every hotelier must employ if they want to keep up with the market and increase their source of revenue.",https://rategain.com/blog/new-data-sources-to-help-commercial-teams-make-better-decisions/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Data-Sources-that-can-help-commercial-teams-make-better-decisions-1.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Data-Sources-that-can-help-commercial-teams-make-better-decisions-1.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,,,,,,,,0

656327d4a3f6fc78b8eba1ba,1709573444,Bridging Silos in Commercial Teams Post Pandemic,"August 25, 2022","The 2020 pandemic has affected the world in more than one way, especially in terms of communication within a business setting. The world saw a complete halt in effective collaborations, and people were more disconnected than ever. Teams that generally worked relatively harmoniously in person were left at the mercy of zoom and emails.In fact, between 2019 and 2020, Professor Tiona W. Zuzul at the Harvard Business School, along with 11 other researchers, studied over 360 billion emails across 1.3 billion accounts of 4361 organizations. They discovered a significant increase in business silos in the year 2020.Eventually, people found their way out of the rut to some extent. However, bottlenecks persist as more and more companies shut down their physical offices and go fully remote. After all, as technologically dependent as we are, some things are best done in person.\n\nNevertheless, there are ways to bridge the gap – especially in the hotel industry. Let’s dive in to understand how silos can affect us and how we can overcome the challenges attached to them.Table of ContentsUnderstanding silos in the pastDiscussing the past is less than effective in an era that is rightly termed the digital revolution. After all, the earlier hotel chains rarely utilized any technology. However, it is crucial to observe the differences, especially the importance of the different stakeholders and how it has evolved. In fact, Silos existed in the past, too, even without a global pandemic to trigger their offshoot.Most notably, the revenue manager role has seen a rather meek existence in the past. The earliest hotel chain systems had no concept of a revenue manager. Traditionally, data collection and processing took long hours and caused many issues for the team.Later, even when the revenue manager role was introduced, the pertinent idea was that a revenue manager is a person who sits in the basement, away from the rest of the team members. They had little to do with day-to-day operations. Moreover, they only reported to higher-ups, such as the sales director.These ideas do not exist anymore. Revenue managers are at the center of a lot of the commercial aspects of the business. Read along to know more about the evolution of the revenue manager’s role.Role of the revenue managerAs discussed above, silos have existed for a long time, albeit in smaller numbers and at a more manageable level. With the pandemic coming into effect, these silos have increased in number, and things such as data transparency have taken a backseat.At this juncture, revenue managers can step in and take over the discussions surrounding the commerciality of an organization.\n\nToday, every stakeholder is on a more equal footing. Hence revenue managers don’t just report to the higher-ups anymore. Moreover, they have become the driving force behind any organization – whether they operate from a revenue management center or the hotel site.\n\nRevenue managers are responsible for identifying opportunities that aid the hotels in receiving the most effective business. They also engage with the sales and marketing teams to adopt holistic approaches in terms of the commercial aspect of the company.Commercial strategies to bridge silosDespite the existence of silos previously, the pandemic has forced organizations to really evaluate where their organizational framework stands today. Owners and majority stakeholders have requested the implementation of things such as:1. Using communication tools that encourage collaborationToday, newer collaboration software molded especially for businesses is finding its way into the mainstream quicker than ever. Thus, companies can consider investing in one of these communication tools.Using messaging platforms like Slack or Teams can also offer a space for employees to communicate with those not in their immediate vicinity. Internal social media networks like Yammer, Workplace, or Google Workspace can help foster a feeling of community.Some software is especially beneficial for facilitating cross-functional collaboration by allowing staff to access data from outside their department. Therefore, whether personnel from various departments could work together on a new project is worth considering. This provides for a degree of openness that has the potential to tear down walls and bridge silos.Moreover, using a tool especially fashioned to serve the hotel industry, such as RateGain, can be especially helpful in solving the problem of tracking KPIs that point towards:2. Encouraging collaboration trainingThere are numerous business training options, including those that encourage employees to learn new communication techniques. This promotes better team collaboration.Training experts are typically interested in deciphering why groups communicate with one another in the manner that they do. They question employees’ assumptions about others as well as their views about the company’s culture.Some organizations will attempt to “reprogram” employees’ interpersonal abilities. They will assist them in being more tolerant of their colleagues.This encourages folks with a silo mindset to think about the sentiments of others who are not in their silo. While costly, if the siloing is severe, it may be the best option for developing overall empathy and removing divides.3. Connecting people via a common goalOne of the issues with communication silos is the existence of competing interests. Employees are split into different groups when they would not otherwise be. And there is no issue with it. However, striving for an overarching purpose that promotes the company’s greater interests is critical.The best strategy to promote cohesiveness among employees is to connect them to a company goal. Employees should be encouraged to communicate on something that characterizes the company as a whole.Another option is for the marketing division to draft an internal manifesto. This fosters a shared understanding of what the organization represents and what it aspires to achieve. It can help keep staff engaged and help them visualize their contributions to the organization.The road aheadThe inevitability of business evolution is apparent in the way business silos have transformed from the days before a revenue manager. Siloing was among the foreseeable changes that the hotel industry would witness. With the dawn of the pandemic, the process has only accelerated.But today, we own the resources to fill this divide and create a stronger workplace. The revenue manager is the new commercial manager who leads the discussions on how hotels can maximize profits. And not just in terms of rooms and F&B, but also in terms of cost of acquisition.They have gone from looking at segments to focusing on segment channels to drive and maximize the opportunities deciphered thanks to revenue managers. The other teams use these insights to develop goals that can help one central goal – driving profits for the organization.Not only that, business communication tools, collaboration training staff, and even creating a manifesto can help remove firmer silos. This can encourage an environment of camaraderie and togetherness. However, the one foolproof way to find the right footing in such a scenario is by adopting a tool such as RateGain – a software specialized for bridging gaps in the hotel industry.",https://rategain.com/blog/bridging-silos-in-commercial-teams-post-pandemic/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Post-pandemic.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Post-pandemic.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,ROI,,,,,,,0
656327d7a3f6fc78b8eba1bc,-133888148,Data Transparency: The New Way to Collaborate in Commercial Teams,"August 25, 2022","The pandemic changed the way we interacted with one another and more importantly, altered the way we collaborated in a business setting.Over the years, data has become extremely vital due to its contribution in helping businesses stay on top. They can monitor and record KPIs and thus, boost business performance. However, most people did not anticipate how quickly it would become the basis of collaboration across different stakeholders in a particular organization.The hospitality industry, too, experienced this phenomenon as people transitioned into the virtual world. Here is some insight into how data has helped the hospitality industry break new ground in terms of collaboration.Table of ContentsThe importance of data transparency during collaborationEqual access to data is a big prerequisite in any collaborative effort. In fact, data is especially crucial in the era of Zoom meetings and virtual brainstorming sessions. Everyone is in different spaces, scattered across different parts of the world—making data transparency the most important factor to keep everyone on the same page.Not only that, data should have three distinct qualities for strategic use:People should be able to utilize this data to create one uniform goal and adopt the motto of “one team, one objective.” However, this does not imply that the different departments do not have goals based on their own KPIs. It only needs to serve a common umbrella goal of increasing revenue for the organization at hand.Empowering team members on their contributionBeing a part of a team is all about empowering one another, acknowledging the work of fellow team members. The hospitality industry particularly thrives on the qualities of empathy, inclusivity and inquisitiveness. Hence, it is expected that leaders in hospitality will take the time to empower their colleagues.For example, holding regular team meetings bringing people together isn’t only a way to catch up on the week’s progress—it allows individual employees to comprehend the different ways that they contribute to the company. In turn, this helps boost employee morale and even invites volunteers when the time comes.Here are other ways team leaders can help their crew feel empowered:1. Offering them a draftBefore there is a final product, there is a draft. It is imperfect and vulnerable and may require a whole range of revisions before it comes to life as a final product. Nevertheless, offering the draft to your employees is an excellent way to make your employees feel valued. It helps them realize that their inputs matter from the first stage to the last.2. Inviting feedback from all team membersOnce this draft has gone out, the next step is usually revisions. Checking off the flaws and reinforcing the pros in a draft is best done in a team full of brains running full-throttle. So, open up the floor and invite employee feedback. Encourage every member to present their opinions and how to better improve the plan.3. Offer periodic updatesAnother great way to ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page is to roll out periodic updates about the project. Send out notifications, host team meetings, and make announcements about the project’s progress. At the end of it, hold a joint conference and provide visibility on the type of impact that the different teams have had on the project.If certain members have had a massive impact on the project, it is best to let them know. After all, everyone is working towards the same goals, but this was only the result of the varied goals pursued by different teams.Ensuring that every member has an understanding of the KPIsThe hospitality industry has a wide range of KPIs. Industry leaders often think that it could help to cut some of them out. This is because while KPIs are handy when evaluating progress, not everyone is privy to what each of them implies.This brings us to the question – “can we really explain KPIs to a wider audience?”Probably not. The number and jargon-heavy nature of the same make it near-impossible for everyone to discern. Therefore, the primary objective of collaborating across channels is to ensure that every stakeholder knows what each KPI stands for.It is helpful to remember that while this transparent consolidated database is valuable, it is not everyone’s cup of tea. For example, revenue managers are incredibly receptive to numbers and spreadsheets of data. On the other hand, sales and marketing teams respond more positively to a visualized story of the data.This is why having an automated system that visualizes KPI numbers onto the screen can be highly beneficial. The different KPIs will tell one story. In turn, members of a relevant team can draw up a hypothesis and hopefully recommend solutions.Using technology to elevate problem-solving processesRateGain can transform how the hospitality industry collaborates and communicates between stakeholders. With the goal of revenue maximization at its core, an automated tool like RateGain can help to not only eliminate roadblocks but elevate the whole process.\n\nMoreover, it can help push for better productivity and enhance efficiency. This way, things, and processes are adopted far quicker to the marketplace – an essential requirement in today’s rapidly changing business climate.Closing thoughtsIn most industries worldwide, fewer than 15% of the managers make it a point to stir engagement among their team members. This is a pitiable number since engagement is the only way to buzz past the stagnation of working remotely between different stakeholders.Thus, adopting data and its visualization is critical when it comes to picking up the pace of collaboration. It is vital to let your teammates know that they have a far more significant impact on how the organization functions.Further, it is crucial to involve them every step of the way. This will help boost participation and possibly allow the organization to develop better solutions.However, the easiest way to ensure successful collaboration is through a tool that simplifies and visualizes a team’s progress. It can help tell a story and empower team members with the knowledge of KPIs, making a profit and higher revenues a reality rather than a pipe dream.",https://rategain.com/blog/data-transparency-the-new-way-to-collaborate-in-commercial-teams/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Data-Transparency.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Data-Transparency.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,ROI,,,,,,,0
656327d8a3f6fc78b8eba1be,-504948972,Are Middle East Hoteliers Ready for the Next Big Shift?,"July 18, 2022","People traveling abroad on leisure or business often prefer an experiential visit rather than solely staying at a property. In this regard, the Middle East is currently a highly attractive destination owing to the several experiences it has to offer.Dubai for instance, recently saw exceptionally high volumes of travel owing to the Expo 2020 event which garnered global attention. Despite its conclusion, the Middle East is not done with its share of globally important events.For starters, there is the FIFA World Cup, a much-anticipated event that occurs every four years. Come November 2022, and Qatar plays host to the 2022 FIFA World Cup comprising 32 teams from as many countries around the world vying for top honors in the sport.Table of ContentsBut what does it mean for a hotelier?Even if as a hospitality professional in the Middle East, you are not a fan of the sport, it still has major implications for the industry at large. Firstly, you can expect a large influx of fans coming down to watch the matches, which translates to hotel bookings and a fillip to local tourism.Talks are already ripe in stakeholders wanting “to leave visitors beyond satisfied with their Qatar travel experience.” Additionally, the infrastructure in Qatar is being developed at a rapid pace to draw tourists in the hordes during the World Cup. In fact, preparations for the World Cup stadia already have sustainability built into the design, with Stadium 974 for example being built using repurposed ocean shipping containers that can be completely dismantled after the conclusion of the tournament.QatarSustainable tourism is on top of Qatar’s national agenda and is at the epicenter of the Qatar National Vision 2030. The Qatari government firmly believes in the need to strike a balance between tourist footfalls and infrastructure development, and environmental protection. Thus, the process of developing and empowering environmental institutions that will work to scale up public awareness about environmental protection issues is in full flow – A positive for environmentally conscious tourists.This major World Cup event has its ripples not just in the host country of Qatar. Neighboring Middle Eastern countries have been quick to respond to the opportunity, with Iran announcing a Visa fee waiver for world cup spectators to come to experience the hospitality that Iran has to offer.Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia’s tourism and hospitality sector too is well on its way to recovery post-pandemic. Programs such as Riyadh Season, combined with growing consumer confidence in travel, have benefitted the cities of Riyadh and Jeddah, transforming them into key travel hubs in KSA for the second half of 2021, and this trend is expected to continue having a positive impact on hotel demand in 2022 as well. The forecasted occupancy for 2022 in Riyadh is 65 percent with 54 percent projected for Jeddah, representing a 12 and 7 percent increase respectively.Apart from a strong performance shown in the hospitality sector, and demand indicators showing a positive outlook for 2022 in the KSA, the Kingdom has announced several new hospitality projects to drive growth including:Major industry updates and insights like these help DMOs, Airlines, Hotels and Tourism Agencies to anticipate demand and plan their marketing activities and execute them accordingly. It is highly critical to collects such forward-looking data from a large number of sources, analyzes it and presents it in an easy to consume format, making it much easier for professionals to take corrective or presumptive action.Key TakeawaysAbout the AuthorVicky Rawal\n\nVP-Commercial, South Asia and MEA\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/are-middle-east-hoteliers-ready-for-the-next-big-shift/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Are-Middle-East-Hoteliers-Ready-for-the-Next-Big-Shift.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Are-Middle-East-Hoteliers-Ready-for-the-Next-Big-Shift.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,2022 FIFA World Cup,Demand forecasting,Hotel,Middle East,Post-Pandemic,,,0
656327daa3f6fc78b8eba1c0,479910463,Artificial Intelligence in the Hospitality Industry : The Future,"July 13, 2022","Artificial Intelligence in the Hospitality Industry – Planning a trip is always fascinating but making it perfect is always cumbersome. Nowadays, travelers do not weigh money against memories, they do not mind paying more for creating unforgettable memories. Even though technology has made it simpler to find details about destinations, read reviews, check property images, the overload of information has made decision making more complex. On top of it, being stuck between the corporate and business lifestyle, maintaining work life balance etc, the travelers don’t get exclusive time to research, plan and book their travel. Therefore, they need information at their own time, which could be while they are multitasking. And the only way to make that happen is through their mobiles.This is where Conversational-AI or chatbots have come into play, these are slowly but steadily transforming travel and hospitality industry. When you hear the word chatbots – Siri and Alexa probably comes to mind, but there is a huge world beyond these which are shaping the future of travel.AI-powered chatbots offer the travel industry a unique opportunity to transform their operations and make it more guest friendly. With conversational chatbots, the travel industry can cater to the needs and demands of digitally savvy travelers and help them stay ahead of the competition. Chatbots have the potential to streamline the guest experience and deliver personalized solutions.Conversational AI has the potential to act as an advantage for Artificial Intelligence in the Hospitality Industry as listed below.Table of Contents1. Instant Replies and AcknowledgementPeople have little to no patience for getting a response on basic questions like ‘Where is breakfast?’, ‘What is Wi-Fi Password?’ to even some complex queries where they would like to book an experience. AI chatbots help address most of these questions in real-time and even reduces the need of guest to reach out to a phone number, operator etc. Some studies state that 75%+ of questions are repetitive and can be clubbed into what we call as FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). AI can easily answer the same reducing the dependency on your front desk, wait time for guest and in effect increase Guest Satisfaction scores.2. Higher EngagementTraditionally, big chains have been promoting their own websites and apps to increase engagement. Studies show that instant messaging is far more powerful tool than sending communication on website or on hotel applications. The Big Chains have managed to drive loyalty via apps, but regional chains, small hotels and standalone luxury properties are not that popular across the globe for people to download their apps. Instant messaging with proactive and reactive reach does help bridge this gap. 98% of instant messages are replied to within 20 minutes.A message from WhatsApp-branded API with hotel name and logo has 5 times more impact than an email being sent with same details. Adding more value to this is its ability to be available 24*7 because of AI, so now the guests can communicate and engage as per their convenience.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-15504 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms.jpg"" alt=""instant messaging platform"" width=""1080"" height=""599"" srcset=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms.jpg 1080w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms-300x166.jpg 300w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms-1024x568.jpg 1024w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms-150x83.jpg 150w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms-768x426.jpg 768w, https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms-20x11.jpg 20w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"" />3. Higher RevenueChatbots accelerate your business starting from brand awareness, engagement, bringing the WOW experience and leading the guest to spend more. The ease of buying through your phone at one place, rather than coordinating at various places and paying up separately makes chatbots case much stronger. AI-powered chatbots go a step ahead in personalizing the customer experience and enhancing the guest’s stay with their high-grade assistance. They present the right offer at the right time to the right guest, making the upselling probability much higher.4. Increase Efficiency, Reduce CostThe travel and hospitality industry gets a repeated set of questions from various guests. Having a human customer-care representative responding to the queries repeatedly is inefficient. Traditionally, hotels increase their morning staffing basis their previous night occupancy to manage guest services, where majority land up answering FAQ.In the age of chatbots, these routine queries can get easily resolved by the instant messaging without any human intervention, which in turn enables customer support staff to focus on other complex tasks boosting productivity and efficiency of the organization. The chatbots are cost effective when compared to labour cost especially in hotels, where customer facing clients are expected to be highly skilled and does come at a premium.The hotel industry is increasingly employing conversational AI and robotic automation technologies, but there’s still a huge ground to cover. It has a huge potential but is underpenetrated.Engage-AI is RateGain’s Virtual Assistant Conversational AI platform which helps optimize your hotel’s operations, create upsell opportunities and generate more revenue per guest, ultimately enhancing guest experience and increasing satisfaction scores for the hotel.For an in-depth guide on Engage-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with our experts “here”",https://rategain.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-future-of-hospitality-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-En-2-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-En-2-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Opportunity-Todays-Conversations-are-on-Instant-Messaging-Platforms.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Blog,,,ChatBOT,Conversational AI solutions,Engage Ai,Livechat,virtual concierge upsell,,,0
656327dba3f6fc78b8eba1c2,-344485400,What is Engage-AI? What are the benefits of using Engage-AI?,"July 7, 2022","What is Engage-AI?  | How is Engage-AI built? | What is Engage-AI used for? | What are the benefits of using Engage-AI? | How soon can it start working for me?Travel experience business is high touch as no two travelers are the same. Travelers often have multiple questions pertaining to their hotel stay. These questions are intended to help them understand how to optimize their stay experience. Plans are made based on information that is known to them. Often the guest thinks of a new question and approaches the front desk or a guest services dedicated line to get answers to these questions. Since a hotel houses several guests, these volumes of interactions become a bottleneck as they are handed by a human on the other side. This results in suboptimal stay experiences and also investment to increase their guest services team.  \n\nThis is where a Livechat/ ChatBOT/ Virtual assistant / Conversational AI comes in. Let’s call them all ‘Virtual assistant(s)’ for the sake of simplicity. It uses an automated mechanism to understand questions and respond in real time based on its knowledge about the property.Table of ContentsWhat is Engage-AI? \n\nEngage-AI is RateGain’s virtual assistant that leverages commonly used B2C communication channels like WhatsApp and FB messenger to help hotel guests interact with the hotel to seek guidance and information regarding their stay and visit. Engage-AI is totally free for the guest and helps them in getting access to real time information.How is Engage-AI built? \n\nEngage-AI is built in three steps. We start with the objective which is to understand a guest’s requirements in an accurate manner and provide the right guidance based on that requirement. This can be reactive (guest queries) or proactive (guest upsells). Once the objective is defined, we build the algorithm that can cater to the specific objective. Finally, we aim to get the right data to be able to deliver on this expectation.What is Engage-AI used for?Engage-AI is a virtual assistant that is use by the:Guest: To get all their queries answered on a real time basis with ease of use. We have kept it simple. It does not entail you having to download specific apps or chat tools. Engage-AI integrates with your daily use messaging app and can be used to interact with hotel agents to seek information on hotel facilities. No longer do you have to wait in line or listen to music while you are ‘On Hold’. Woke up late? And want to find out the time when breakfast is served, send a quick text and get a reply in less than a second. This is just an example. Engage-AI answers several such questions without any wait. \n\nHotel: Engage-AI is used by the hotel to share promotions and other products and services that the hotel has to offer. The offers are sent on your messaging app, they are personalized, non-invasive. Engage-AI is mindful and does not take a cookie cutter approach and these messages have a higher conversion rate without sounding too salesy.What are the benefits of using Engage-AI?Engage-AI is used to accomplish three specific objectives.1. Guest Satisfaction: How many times have you tried to ask a question but been put on hold or have had to wait at the reception behind a long queue. The main reason for this friction in interaction is a model of One communicating with many in a sequential manner. This is also frustrating as the agent ends up answering similar questions which makes their job repetitive and boring. When Conversational AI takes over, our research shows that 92% of guest queries can get answered in real time with a high degree of accuracy.2. Maximize Revenue: Personalization helps in pitching the right offers to the right guest at the right time for the right price and with Engage-AI, the chances of conversion increases manifold.3. Cost Efficiency: Hotels invest in variable manual costs to service guests during peak periods. In the absence of predictable traffic, service can take a beating. Its always hard to optimize staffing for occupancy. Sometimes the hotel agents can get multiple queries with 60% inhouse occupancy and on the other hand, even 90% plus occupancy nights can be quiet. Engage-AI is an ideal choice to help you save on cost as well as increase guest satisfaction.What are the challenges of automating conversations and how Engage-AI helps? The challenge in building conversational AI technology starts with the ability to recognize the intent of the text. Automated conversations end of sounding very cookie cutter and may be a turnoff if done out of context.  Engage-AI is a RateGain product specifically dedicated to the travel industry. Engage-AI is backed by deep domain expertise in this space.How soon can it start working for me?The system can be up and running within a week. The system can be used independent of any other technology platforms. However, for best performance, we recommend a 2 way PMS integration.RateGain and Engage-AIEngage-AI is powered by RateGain, the industry’s foremost AI led travel technology provider. We are one of the largest aggregators of travel data across the world as per PhocusWright. RateGain’s advanced text analysis can structure all the unstructured data. In any use case that AI is solving, the model is only as effective as the quantity of data and with RateGain the models have gained a high degree of accuracy due to the volume and variety of data that we store, process and analyze.",https://rategain.com/blog/all-about-engage-ai/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-En-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-En-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Blog,,,ChatBOT,Conversational AI solutions,Engage Ai,Livechat,virtual concierge upsell,,,0
656327dca3f6fc78b8eba1c4,-1152066467,Enjoy Greater Conversions by Offering Mobile Rates to your Prospective Customers,"June 30, 2022","Mobility – Perhaps the biggest buzzword in the last couple of years, fast-paced lifestyles have prompted the need for most people to ditch computers and switch to Mobile devices for internet access.As per May 2022 data sourced from Statcounter, a whopping 59.02% of the Internet traffic comes from mobile devices as compared to 38.65% from Desktops.This heightened demand for mobility opens up new marketing avenues for businesses in the travel and hospitality sector.Table of ContentsMobile Rates – Drive Traffic from Device-Specific ChannelsMobile Rates by Booking.com are specially discounted rates offered to guests browsing for hotel room reservations through a mobile app or a mobile browser. This helps generate more conversions as new customers on the lookout for great deals are likely to book without second thoughts, and loyal bookers are likely to come back to the mobile site/app repeatedly.This is more relevant in the travel segment, where Travelport Digital estimates that as many as 80% of travelers use a mobile app while researching a holiday trip they are planning.Mobile Rates as on Booking.comAbout 5 years ago, when Mobile took over as the preferred device for customers on Booking.com, more than half the accommodation reservations made in 2018 were through a mobile device, either using the Booking.com app or the Booking.com mobile website.Presently, the Booking.com app is the most downloaded travel app on the planet for Jan-Mar 2022, thus making it the fastest-growing booker segment.To help partner hotels make the most of this trend, Booking.com offers partners the ability to boost their booking by as much as 22% by setting mobile rates on their properties.Connected properties can set up these mobile rates in their property management systems using RezGain, a hotel channel manager of choice by RateGain.

Thirdly, it boosts your property’s visibility on the platform.Occupancy: By offering a discounted mobile-only rate, potential guests are more likely to book, thus driving traffic to your property and improving the occupancy.\n\n\n\nConversions: People who notice a marked difference in the prices on the mobile sites are more likely to book, thus resulting in increased conversions and sales.Visibility: Offering a better price is more likely to show your property on the top of the list when filtered and sorted by discounts, mobile-only rates, or price. Properties that offer Mobile Rates benefit from a special badge appearing next to the property name, both on search results and on your property page.Additionally, people who get a great deal are more likely to review and recommend your property, thus boosting visibility, reputation, and booker confidence.Setting Mobile Rates through RezGainAt RezGain, we’ve partnered with Booking.com to bring Mobile Rate management directly on our platform, accessible and configurable with a few clicks.

656327dea3f6fc78b8eba1c6,1385322233,Improving Business by Offering Country Rates to Prospective Customers,"June 21, 2022","In the past couple of months, we’ve seen strong indicators of an increase in global travel, with heightened demand for international flights. This signals that recovery to pre-pandemic levels is on the cards. Newer travel corridors are constantly opening up, prompted by the easing of travel restrictions between countries. The moment is now ripe to cash in on this trend and tap into newer source markets.Attracting guests from countries that are seeing higher demand in terms of international travel would be pretty lucrative – driving up your top line and margins multifold. This is where country specific rates can help you make the most out of this emerging trend.Table of ContentsCountry Rates – Drive Traffic from Specific Source MarketsWhether you wish to enter newer markets, attract guests from specific countries or provide customized and targeted discounts, the simplest solution would be to opt for country specific rates.‘Country rate’ is a feature of Booking.com, now integrated into our RezGain smart distribution hotel channel management software, which allows you to offer targeted discounts to prospective guests from varied markets of your choice.Combining this with granular data on specific patterns or trends observed in different countries through demand forecasting and analysis solutions such as Demand.AI, you can easily optimize all your demand channels for maximum growth, with just a few minor tweaks to the rates.Even after all this, if you’re not quite sure which countries might work best for you, simply head to your property’s extranet page and a personalized country rate recommendation made on the basis of collected data would be readily available for you. This includes data points such as holiday periods and special events occurring in certain markets that can prompt travel.However, based on the prevalent rules and restrictions in certain countries, the availability of country rate feature for your property might be limited or curbed.The Advantages and Benefits of Country RatesApart from these key factors, opting for country-specific rates can help you get more bookings internationally, where guests are more likely to spend higher than domestic travelers, and tend to cancel less often.Most importantly, offering competitive rates automatically boosts your property’s visibility to the top of the rankings in people’s searches, as they often tend to predominantly filter and sort based on pricing.Setting Country Rates through RezGainAt RezGain, we’ve partnered with Booking.com to bring Country Rate management directly on our platform, accessible and configurable within a few clicks. Simply head over to the property you wish to set country rates for, and define the rates.RezGain’s smart distribution channel manager will automatically update and reflect these rates for your properties across multiple channels, thus ensuring maximum visibility and better reach.The country rates are visible only to guests from that specific country (identified using the customer’s IP address), which makes it viable to offer these discounts without worries of misuse of the offers. The rate of discount is completely customizable, but recommended to be set at 10% or more by Booking.com.\n\nThese rates apply to all your rooms and rate plans for site visitors from the selected country all year round, but up to 30 dates can be configured through the course of the year when the offered discount does not apply.Note: Country rate discounts are provided over and above any other promotion you may have set or opted for, including the Booking.com Genius program for partners. The only exceptions where these rates don’t apply include mobile-specific rates and Deal of the Day promotions.Does it make sense for me?After all this talk about what Country Rates are, and how they can help bring in newer customers, the biggest question to be answered is whether it makes business sense to implement it for your properties.Seen from a costs-to-returns perspective alone, it is clear that more targeting leads to more business. Combining this with effective analytics, you’ll clearly be able to stand out from your competition and achieve much higher overall growth.To try out the Country Rates feature, head over to your RezGain dashboard now!

656327dfa3f6fc78b8eba1c8,-738558250,The Role of Metasearch in Pandemic Recovery,"May 31, 2022","Change is the only constant.The travel industry has weathered many changes over the past several years, and we are constantly looking into our crystal ball to predict what will come tomorrow.Technology innovations lead the way, and the repetitive themes include AI, Personalization, and of course, Google.These three themes all have one common point of convergence, and that is Metasearch Marketing.However, this is also where we need to look a bit deeper to better understand how and why these themes come together.Let’s start with Google. Google has been, is, and will continue to be the dominant force in hospitality marketing. Most consumer searches quite simply start with Google. Ask most of those same consumers “Did you book through Google” and they will likely say “No, I booked through _____.” What they don’t realize is they touched Google somewhere along the way.Google has been actively transforming their travel ecosystem, to the point of having their own OTA-like immersive travel page.The real genius in what they have done is that they have created an entirely new landscape that can reap the rewards of CPC (cost per click). The results below show PPC (Pay Per Click) ads for what are effectively non-branded search terms.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Role-of-Metasearch-in-Pandemic-Recovery-1.png"" alt=""Pay per click Ads"" width=""1486"" height=""823"" />What better way to increase the revenue from your real estate than to create more real estate?This first example features a simple search for “hotels in New York City” and the PPC ads associated with it.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Role-of-Metasearch-in-Pandemic-Recovery-2.png"" alt=""Pay per click Ads"" width=""1486"" height=""823"" />Once we expand this view, we are taken to a more immersive travel page featuring (you guessed it), more PPC ads at the very top of the list in the form of Google Promoted Properties.These examples exist in different forms across many of the metasearch channels including TripAdvisor Sponsored Placements.Such ads are commonly referred to as Destination Marketing Ads. DMAs are “metasearch-adjacent” ads with options to link-off to both your hotel and/or OTA partners.The reason I reference this is it exemplifies how Google is shifting traffic from their traditional non-branded search space into a more immersive travel experience. This is good for the consumer and hotelier alike.Likewise, we have already seen traffic from your branded search terms become cannibalized by the metasearch points of sale featured in your Google Business Profile (formerly known as Google My Business listing).The branded and non-branded search queries are already shifting to these areas, which addresses our 1st point of why metasearch plays a key role in the pandemic recovery.That leads us to the second point – Personalization. We have been talking about the demise of third party cookies for quite some time now. While this has been temporarily delayed, we know it is eventually going to happen. Many articles have been & will be written about how to adapt to this, but the most effective way is quite simple. Get first party data. This means getting the user directly to your website.Personalization takes many forms, and I could draft an entire article on that topic alone. However, it all starts with the data, and this is where hoteliers can surpass OTAs. Metasearch, along with other direct booking campaigns, plays an instrumental role in driving our direct traffic.Direct bookings have been a popular topic for many years, with valid comments about cost of sale, higher conversions and ROI taking center stage. Let’s not forget another important factor – communication.We don’t want to say it, but we all know it’s true. It’s only a matter of time before a hotel somewhere has to temporarily close, notify a guest of upcoming renovations or reach out about any number of reservation issues. Would you prefer to contact the guests yourself, or let an OTA handle this for you?Finally, we must consider the AI (Artificial Intelligence). We see several companies who have made amazing progress in developing machine learning algorithms to help optimize campaign performance based on available market levers. (If your metasearch campaign manager isn’t using AI, let’s talk!)However, what has been happening behind the scenes makes this a little more interesting. Google quietly released a new booking lever that allows bid adjustments by a specific date. TripAdvisor has even had this out a bit longer than Google.Date-based bidding is possibly the most requested, but also the most underused bid lever in the history of metasearch. Why? Quite simply, it is impossible to go through every hotel for every date and make bid adjustments based on occupancy. (Are you using an AI powered demand tool? We have a solution for that too!).Automation can solve this by pulling in occupancy data. Once we have that element, we can start building rules such as “If my occupancy = 90% then adjust bids as follows.”The result of such automation is we see a merger of revenue and campaign management to help drive marketing efforts towards the right guest at the right time.Take this a step further and imagine how such automation could influence the DMAs we mentioned earlier. For example, if I know my hotel is less than 50% occupancy, but I have demand data showing a high market interest for a selected time frame, I could modify my Destination Ads to run more aggressively over these dates.Metasearch Marketing stands at the intersection of the 3 most prevalent marketing themes for 2022 – Google, Personalization, and AI. The ability to combine these within one holistic campaign strategy will set the course for years to come.As we collectively move towards a solid post-pandemic recovery, RateGain has a number of products that can help you with your Metasearch efforts.

656327e1a3f6fc78b8eba1ca,-843125278,Why Forward-looking Demand Intelligence is all the More Important for a Destination and it's DMO Today?,"March 31, 2022","The past few years of Covid 19 haven’t discriminated between people, industries, or geographies. After disrupting most of the global economy, the pandemic now seems to be easing a bit, thus putting businesses back on a trajectory of recovery. Nonetheless, challenges remain aplenty.Today, we shift our focus to Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs), Convention & Visitor Bureaus (CVBs), and Destination Management Companies (DMCs).From a travel and destination tourism standpoint, DMOs, CVBs, and DMCs play a crucial role in promoting and driving visitors to a location, making it an attractive tourist destination and consequentially bringing in revenues.Table of ContentsData Acquisition Challenges faced by DMOsDMOs haven’t had it easy with the pandemic.Due to the lingering uncertainty of travel recovery, gauging segments and source markets that are likely to recover faster is harder than ever. Traditionally, all the required information for demand forecasting was sourced from historical data and high-level travel trends.However, all historical data available currently for the past couple of years has been skewed, marred with tourism coming to a standstill during the pandemic. Even current travel behavior is hard to predict, with recovery patterns being volatile and easily influenced by current events that could disrupt travel – Omicron for example.Without the knowledge of where the travellers are coming from, what is their profile, what are the popular areas a traveler would like to visit, the kind of accommodation they are looking for and how much they are willing to spend, it becomes difficult for DMOs to come up with actionable plans to drive footfalls.Thus, there is a strong need for accurate, forward-looking, granular, and actionable intelligence that can help DMOs/DMCs to bring in better revenues.Anticipating Demand through reflexive Artificial IntelligenceDMOs need to understand and take into consideration a number of factors while planning a course of action to drive footfalls. Here are some of the top defining factors:However, barely aggregating this data on the surface level doesn’t help. DMOs need precise and accurate data which is the result of intense analysis. Such granular industry insights can be obtained in a better way using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted solutions.RateGain, a destination marketing company, offers Demand-AI, a proprietary solution to help understand and plan demand forecasts and achieve all this and much more by unlocking key insights aggregated from multiple reliable data sources, thus enabling the DMOs to gauge the parameters driving the trend.Additionally, it helps highlight the ways the DMOs can run campaigns during low-demand days, to maintain a steady footfall or to raise the footfall at the destination market.How Demand AI Addresses  dynamic functioning of DMO Marketing Through Forward Looking Data?DMOs usually have a massive task cut out in order to bring in increased footfall to the destination city. This includes getting newer brands to the destination, improving physical public infrastructure such as roadways, jogging and cycling tracks, adventure parks, and recreational spots by working with the lobbies to lay down an effective roadmap.They also need to look out for emerging markets with high potential to attract travelers, thus facilitating conversions. All these require a huge amount of statistical data to be readily available so that the DMOs can generate more excitement in the source markets through attractive campaigns. The data also helps them review existing campaigns to get the best outcomes.DMCs often work with car rentals, hotels, and airlines to maximize footfall in the city. They also work with municipal corporations to improve tourist attractions and have a better implementation of events, activities, tours, transportation, and program logistics.DMCs often work with car rentals, hotels, and airlines to maximize footfall in the city. They also work with municipal corporations to improve tourist attractions and have a better implementation of events, activities, tours, transportation, and program logistics.Such a diverse array of functions needs constant and dynamically updated data. RateGain, a destination marketing organization, offers Demand-AI, a product powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. RateGain’s Demand Forecasting and Planning Solution provides source market intelligence based on actual travellers.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/source-market-intelligence-1.jpg"" alt=""RateGain’s Demand-AI"" width=""1000"" height=""391"" />Additionally, it offers insights on dates with peak demand and the persona of the expected travelers. Armed with such precise data, DMOs and DMCs can plan their acquisition campaigns with greater clarity, leading to better output.Knowing where exactly the traveler is staying helps DMOs predict future demand in the sub-districts of such locations, and Demand-AI has a solution for that too. The hyperlocal demand index feature provides data on where travelers are headed to within a city for the next 75 days.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/hyperlocal-demand-index.jpg"" alt=""destination marketing organization"" width=""1000"" height=""702"" />Lead-time planning and analysis, another important component in the DMOs arsenal also finds a simplified solution within Demand-AI with data on google searches, bookings, airlines, and hotels showing up for advanced seasonal planning. This data can be used to compare alternate destinations to gauge the demand trend too.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DEMAND-TRENDS.jpg"" alt=""Demand trends- destination marketing"" width=""1000"" height=""404"" />Events play a crucial role in determining the demand for a particular destination. These events could range from concerts, workshops, festivals, public holiday celebrations, sports, theatre, and a lot more. Event intelligence can help identify what kind of events drive travel to a particular destination, how popular these events are, how often do they recur, which pockets in the city are likely to witness an increased demand etc.Demand-AI’s consists of a large data lake stemming from RateGain data aggregated from billions of data points on searches, rate shopping data and bookings from over 300,000+ hotels, 200+ airlines, 50+ OTAs, and vacation rentals globally. DMOs can leverage this strength alongside Demand-AI’s collection of forward-looking demand indicators such as active COVID cases, vaccination numbers, lockdowns/restrictions news, events, weather, airline capacity, and bookings to generate a forecast using AI, that is refreshed on a weekly basis.This forecast report helps identify future travel demand for over 50 major cities across the globe for a period of 75 days in advance, with the dates having the highest demand highlighted for easy analysis. Competition Market share from particular source markets can also be tracked to help DMOs identify the other destinations travelers are flying to.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Destination-Comparison-1.jpg"" alt=""forecast report- destination management organization"" width=""910"" height=""426"" />DMOs can obtain country-level and city-level intelligence for some of the most important and prominent cities and countries in advance for a period of 90 days. By deep-diving into insights that matter, such as the type of airline and aircraft, the traveler segment, and the arrival time and terminal information, DMOs can prepare a detailed plan of action that can help boost revenues.How DMOs can benefit through Demand-AIAs the industry’s first AI-powered demand index and forecasting solution, Demand-AI helps DMOs and DMCs come up with actionable destination development strategies with the help of its forward-looking travel demand insights.As such, it helps them manage and run source market campaigns, while also opening new doors for business by tying up with source market based DMCs. Arranging local marketing events becomes a breeze as the insights can help develop a targeted communication plan with the appropriate local lingo.Through event and traveler analysis, the DMOs can predict the length of stay, and compare it with competitor cities to develop better plans. By identifying the traveler’s common areas of interest, they can plan the infrastructure roadmap for the future in-depth, thus making the destination more attractive for future travel.Armed with demand trends such as high travel dates and low travel dates, it becomes easier to shift marketing gears, adapting to what is required based on demand. By knowing the supply and ADR of hotels, air travel, car rentals, and cruise bookings, DMOs can gauge how pricing fluctuates with predicted demand.Because DMOs deserve the best data interpretation solutions!If you are a Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) or a Destination Management Company (DMC), Demand-AI is the resource you need to generate valuable and actionable demand insights to help drive traffic and help destinations thrive.For an in-depth guide on Demand-AI or to schedule a free demo, get in touch with us here.",https://rategain.com/blog/dmo-destination-marketing-intelligence-strategy/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Actionable-Accurate-Demand-Intelligence-for-DMOs-and-DMCs-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Actionable-Accurate-Demand-Intelligence-for-DMOs-and-DMCs-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/source-market-intelligence-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/hyperlocal-demand-index.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DEMAND-TRENDS.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Destination-Comparison-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,destination marketing,dmo destination marketing,dmo marketing,dmo tourism,dmo tourism marketing,DMOs,,0
656327e3a3f6fc78b8eba1cc,-1255143143,How to Become a Genius and Drive-up Hotel Visibility and Occupancy Rates!,"March 10, 2022","With the easing of global restrictions surrounding the pandemic, things are again starting to look bright for the travel industry. Newer travel corridors are opening and general demand for hotels is picking up. Such being the case, it is essential for hoteliers to cash in on this trend and unlock newer revenue streams and opportunities.All this however is easier said than done right?

656327e5a3f6fc78b8eba1ce,-152896726,Airline Traveler Forecast: Can it help in anticipating demand better?,"March 9, 2022","Post Covid-19 pandemic, businesses across the world are on a recovery curve. The travel and tourism industry is already witnessing improved demand compared to the previous years. However, complete recovery is still some time away. According to a global survey conducted by the UNWTO in January 2022, most experts feel that the recovery to pre-pandemic levels is likely only after 2024 or beyond. Such being the case, the traditional forecasting methods of relying purely on historical data points to map future demand will become grossly insufficient.Revenue Managers and key decision makers from business verticals across the travel and tourism industry are scurrying to find a repertoire of tools that can help them effectively gauge upcoming demand to help plan the future course of action.Table of ContentsIdentifying Future Demand through Artificial IntelligenceThere is a strong need to identify core demand areas and plan for future demand, as organizations need to be aware and equipped to deal with a sudden outburst of demand as well as plan ahead in case of a dull period by adjusting staffing and inventory requirements accordingly.Common traditional methods of forecasting airline travelers include consumer searches on meta channels, understanding capacity data published by Aviation bodies etc. However, in the post-pandemic world, this data is likely to be inaccurate as people might be searching for flights in large numbers but not proceeding with the bookings due to regulatory uncertainties and other apprehensions. Even with regard to airline capacity data, higher capacities do not necessarily translate to utilization, as last-minute cancellations. etc. are not taken into account.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ATF-infographic.jpg"" alt=""forecasting airline travelers"" width=""1805"" height=""764"" />\n\nIncreasingly Airline intelligence consumer needs to leverage a mix of top, middle and bottom of the funnel data to take more accurate decisionsWith most past indicators rendered useless, a shift to an augmented approach, relying on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), has been observed. Having data models that can automatically acquire and analyze multiple data points across the funnel such as Capacity, Bookings, Rates, Search Queries, Covid Data, Travel News/Sentiment/Advisory, Local Occurrences, Business & Leisure Events can help improve the quality of demand forecasting.Enhancing forecasting through ATF on Demand-AIHaving launched Demand-AI last year, we’ve been able to successfully gauge demand trends for over 60 cities across the world. The AI-assisted engine of the solution takes into consideration the extreme volatility in recovery and focuses on forward-looking, real-time indicators such as flight capacity, current events, Covid restrictions, booking parameters, etc. to provide a numerical index of demand, thus helping businesses forecast demand for up to 90 days ahead.Today we’re happy to share a breakthrough update to our Demand Forecasting solution at RateGain – Airline Traveler Forecasting.Anticipating Travel to Plan Future DemandIn the current scenario, granular analysis of airline travel data is often overlooked. This is quite surprising actually, considering that such in-depth analysis would lead to valuable insights for demand forecasting. Higher demand for airline travel would subsequently trickle down to increased demand for hotels and car rentals.One could argue that the lack of automation tools to acquire such data and the tediousness of manually scouring through data even if it were made available, could be a reason for the low adoption of such practices. However, we’re changing all that with the introduction of our Airline Traveler Forecasting (ATF) dashboard within the Demand-AI platform.ATF is a RateGain proprietary model that helps users forecast and anticipate travel in the near future based on inbound airline data aggregated from 3rd party sources such as flight schedules and GDS bookings, as well as internal data collected through Demand-AI that includes OND Airfares, Macro-level data such as Current Events and Covid related news.Source Market Intelligence\n\nThe dashboard includes several tools including Source Market Intelligence that provides granular level data reports of up to 90 days on Source Markets that are driving traffic into the Destination City. The indicators for the next 30, 60, 90 days and total expected traffic is shown in a tabulated format. Comparison against the past couple of years is also possible.\n\n<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Source-Market-Intelligence.jpg"" alt=""Airline Traveler Forecast"" width=""891"" height=""377"" />Destination Comparison\n\nDestination Comparison helps to compare how different competitor destinations are performing with respect to varied source markets, thus giving an overview of which markets need attention while planning anticipated demand, and to what extent the cities nearest to you are attracting traffic from these source markets.\n\n<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Destination-Comparison-1.jpg"" alt=""Destination Comparision"" width=""910"" height=""426"" />One can also get insights into the kind of airlines that the travelers are taking. This includes intelligence on Scheduled Passenger Flights as well as Scheduled Charter Flights.Day Wise Intelligence\n\nDay Wise Intelligence provides an opportunity to identify which days of the week are performing better than the others with regard to airline travelers, shown in a monthly aggregate format, with data from the past year also available for comparison.\n\n<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Day-wise-Intelligence-1.jpg"" alt=""Airline travelers insights"" width=""700"" height=""438"" />In addition to forward-looking data, past performance indicators containing actual data including pre-covid years are also sourced from airports and aviation bodies to give a comprehensive overview of the market with a high level of accuracy. Given the dynamic nature of the aviation sector, this report is presented weekly, letting you have the latest comparison against past performance.Relevance across Industry SegmentsThe ATF dashboard isn’t solely restricted to usability in one segment. ATF finds several use cases across multiple industry segments and roles, thus making it an effective tool for the travel and tourism industry as a whole.Apart from obviously helping Revenue Managers and Digital Marketers from Airlines to forecast the load factor, thus being able to come up with specific promotions targeting the right set of travelers, ATF holds a lot of potential for Hotels, Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs), and Martech agencies too.Hotels:\n\nATF helps Revenue Managers forecast occupancy levels, RevPAR, and peak booking dates; along with the origin of travelers thus enabling them to craft targeted strategies such as special rate plans, pricing, and promotion that work in favor of the hotel to increase occupancy. The Operations team can use the available data to prep up their inventory and perform the necessary staffing and manpower management tasks. Using the available ATF data, Digital Marketing teams too can decide which target markets should the marketing dollars go towards, thus capturing a chunk of those travelers.Destination Marketing Organizations:\n\nMarketing Managers from DMOs can utilize the insights provided on the ATF dashboard to identify the source markets where the marketing dollars can be spent. By identifying which market segments are gaining traction and where those travelers are coming from, marketing managers can chalk out an effective plan to obtain a large market share that would otherwise have gone to their competition.Marketing Technology Agencies:\n\nCampaign Managers from Martech agencies can use the available ATF data to modify and optimize the bids accordingly. Based on information about peak travel dates and source markets driving traffic, they can effectively spend the available budget on markets and dates bringing in the most traffic, thus getting the highest value for the marketing spends.Data Scientists from RMS teams can also benefit from the data points provided within ATF to help improve their pricing recommendation mechanisms.Accurate Forecasting for Efficient Demand PreparednessArmed with accurate travel forecast data for 3 months, it is possible to understand the dates and time intervals that lead to the highest demand and the ones that have lower demand. ATF also lets you obtain intelligence on which top airline carriers including scheduled charters are driving travel.Additionally, knowing which source market contributes to the demand can help determine where to spend your marketing focus on, and how best to be prepared for this forecasted demand. Through this data, you can plan an effective strategy to achieve whatever marketing or analytical goal you have set.Airline Travelers Forecast is just one of the benefits of our Demand forecasting solution, Demand-AI.

656327e6a3f6fc78b8eba1d0,1839467353,How can User Experience Help Revenue Managers? Ask AirGain,"January 13, 2022","One of the common pain points with regard to pricing platform is the lack of flexibility in configuration and data collection speed. Customers often ask us for ways to reduce the friction involved in aggregating data points from multiple sources into a single window. Finding rate shopping data that is accurate and intuitive is often a challenge with most solutions out there, and we aim to make a difference.To bring in this change, we’ve enhanced the AirGain platform with a number of developments that deliver intelligence that helps revenue and pricing teams in making quick pricing decisions. In this upgraded, simplified and flexible interface, you can benefit from these latest developments:Table of ContentsCompare Prices Just the Way You Compare Products on Ecommerce WebsitesWe all have used price comparison websites in the last few years and as a user, we always want to see the difference in the quickest time possible.Previously on AirGain, users could track fare history using the Fare Trends tab.While this offered revenue managers an overview of the OND, departure date, type of journey and fare, comparison of multiple data points from the graph was challenging.The enhanced AirGain platform solves this issue by bringing in a comparison framework similar to the comparison modules found on eCommerce platforms.The AirGain platform allows the user to add up to three itineraries in the compare functionality, which can then be viewed in a separate window. This enhances the user experience by allowing the viewer to easily and effortlessly compare between different price points, RBD, FBC, stopovers & seat availability.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AirGain-talk-to-expert-2.png"" alt=""Connect with Experts"" width=""800"" height=""358"" />Now Save Time in Identifying Data for the Right Airline with Color CodesMost rate shoppers compare flight data for dozens of flights or more. In such cases, they tend to use a graphical interpretation, which consists of several graphical lines that show the price points of different airlines. This can often get messy and confusing, thus reducing the usability of the graphical chart feature, with most rate shoppers shifting to manual text reports.To clearly distinguish between airlines across devices or user roles, the AirGain platform allows the Super Admin to set color codes based on airlines or channels, with an upper limit of 55 colors. This allows users to utilize the graphical view to its maximum potential.By choosing a color code that the analyst or viewer recognizes, the amount of time required to analyze the report is drastically reduced, thus making it easy for revenue managers to quickly complete job to be done.As only the super admin can choose the color code globally across the platform, the earlier drawback of each user being displayed a different set of colors for the same airline resulting in confusion during analysis is now mitigated.To change the airline color codes, the Super Admin simply has to visit the Account Setting page and choose the Airline Color code tab. Edit access of this functionality to all users on the platform has been disabled on purpose to avoid accidental changes to the airline color scheme, which could cause a lot of confusion and incorrect reports.Building Transparency in Data CollectionEarlier, while clicking on data points for the search results for fare trends, users faced difficulty in identifying when the data was collected.We are delighted to Introduce a feature in our reports that clearly display when the data was collected gives the customer transparency into how fresh the data is. This also eliminates the task of looking for data from other sources, as the data collection timestamp would help them identify the latest point of data acquisition. Additionally, with information on how long each report execution takes, the revenue managers can set up the report accordingly for when they want they want these reports generated.Having access to data collection timestamps increases customer confidence during analysis as accurate data is readily available.Enhancements to the Platform – Upscaling user-experience In the volatile ecosystem, revenue and pricing teams need quick insights to excel in highly competitive market; an intuitive platform is the need of an hour to provide more power to revenue and pricing teams in making profitable pricing decisions.By introducing these feature enhancements, we’re sure that AirGain would be able to address user challenges, thus becoming the preferred choice for the faster growing airlines in post-covid world.<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AirGain-talk-to-expert-2.png"" alt="""" width=""100%"" />About the Author Vikram Syal \n\nVice President – Product Management\n\nRateGainIn his current role, Vikram Syal leads the Engineering team at RateGain and drives the vision, strategy, and implementation of the integrated systems collaborating with sales, marketing, and other groups to support the ongoing process and customer deliveries.With an experience of 12+ years in various technological disciplines, he is a core product enthusiast, highly inquisitive, and detail-oriented innovative personnel.",https://rategain.com/blog/how-can-user-experience-help-revenue-managers/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AirGain-new-blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AirGain-new-blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AirGain-talk-to-expert-2.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AirGain-talk-to-expert-2.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,AirGain,Flexible,Highly user-friendly platform,Intuitive,Price Comparison,,,0
656327e8a3f6fc78b8eba1d2,1625951660,The Travel Manifesto for 2022,"December 24, 2021","It is no news that 2021 was not the best year for the travel and hospitality industry. In the hope of a fresh start, we are all excited to welcome 2022 with open arms. While any prediction may not be a viable idea during these times, a research commissioned by booking.com throws light on what 2022 may have instore for us. The study paints a very positive outlook for the upcoming year – and would bring a smile on each of our faces.Table of ContentsLet’s dive deeper into the upcoming trends for travel in 2022.Revenge TravelAfter being confined to the four walls of their homes for countless months, people are now looking at ways to break free from the “new normal”. Vaccinated individuals and families want to move away from their inert state of existence. Industry experts have coined this as Revenge Travel, where people go on a vacation for an extended period to make up for the time lost. Infact the same research that booking.com did, highlights, 72% will agree to go on a vacation if the budget permits. This is a pretty good opportunity for the hospitality and travel industry to tap into the revenge travel emotion of people.Experiencing Authentic Local Culture More than half of people manifested a desire, in the research, to benefit local communities because of their travel. With the rise of awareness about diverse cultures and ethnicities, travelers are now keen on experiencing this diversity when on vacation. They are willing to shell a few extra bucks to interact with communities and share their ground-level authentic culture. This augurs well for the local population who have been bearing the brunt of ‘manufactured off-season’ due to pandemic. This is one of the primary reasons for homestays getting more popular amongst travelers across the globe.Remote Work = WorkcationThe concept of remote work has kindled the idea of a workcation. Keen and enthusiastic travelers are now working from exotic locations. Such people have particular demands for their travel needs; for example, they need working quality WiFi. They also prefer a dedicated workstation with a view. Workcationers usually stay at a property for a longer duration. They also demand flexibility when it comes to extending their stays. Hotels, homestays, and resorts are now updating their services according to these special requirements.Embracing Long Road TripsWhile traveling and vacation may be back in the picture, many are still a little apprehensive about hopping on a plane or boarding a train. They prefer road adventures to stay on the safer side, as it is more private, safer and presents an intimate opportunity to enjoy travel with their loved ones. The research proves this, as 75% of people consider the journey more enjoyable when it is a part of the trip. This is a chance for car rental services to make the most of the upcoming year.Splurging on VacationsSome people haven’t traveled in almost two years, which means all of their travel/vacation money is still safely accumulating in their bank accounts. So, the next trip they will take will be one where they may splurge all their saved-up vacation money. This means a rise in demand for suites, luxury destinations, over-the-top experiences, etc. Such travelers are the perfect prospects for luxury resorts & hotel chains in the upcoming year.Making the Journey CountA vacation is no longer going to be about only the destination. Travelers want to make each moment memorable – they want to make the journey an inclusive part of their entire trip. Various travel management agencies were already looking into customized packages for such preferences; now is the time to delve deeper into the nuances of such intent of travelers.Prioritizing Safer StaysTravelers are seriously looking at the safety protocols in place at the property. 70% of travelers are more likely to book a property if it’s clear what health and safety measures are in place (source). They expect transparency. Therefore, hotels need to embrace technology – invest in Content to showcase the facilities at the location. This has the potential to directly impact revenues. The property should mention the sanitization process, local government’s mandate for traveling, etc.Emphasizing on Wellness TravelPost the 2020, people have acknowledged the benefits of travel on overall mental health and wellbeing. 62% of global travellers have realized how essential travel is for their well-being until it was no longer an option. It is a means to rejuvenate and revive. This entails that the hospitality industry can include various self-care experiences and facilities as a part of its package.What do these trends indicate for hotels? It is critical hoteliers understand and embrace this new shift in travel and hospitality. As 2022 approaches, they should include technologies like hotel channel manager into their mix while they review the budget for the year, which can give you access to all leading and long-tail OTAs and demand partners. A hotel channel manager software shouldn’t just push ARI updates in real-time; it is its basic operation. Instead, it should help you discover new revenue by sourcing new markets and demand for you.2022 will witness a new and transformed approach to traveling, where travellers will adopt the ‘new normal’ for vacationing and holidaying.

656327e9a3f6fc78b8eba1d4,1543332251,Marketing Technology in a Data-Driven Era,"October 22, 2021","Table of ContentsHumanize the brandA brand cannot speak for itself, but its people can; the results from people advocacy have proven to be a lot more engaging than data advocacy from a marketing perspective. It can be challenging to penetrate the market across the abundance of free data, but the idea stands on how much we trust that data or the content. What characterizes an organization? How long do customers engage with a targeted website? What type of content caters to the consumer’s interests? What are their resources? What inspires/ influences them? These are the questions content creators have to ask themselves. We come across plenty of content every day. What makes your content stand out? How to get it to engage with the targeted audience? How to get the next desired action?Good content creates great desire. How can your content do just that? Text is informational whereas, vision is influential. 65% of viewers are visual learners. It is crucial to establish a relationship between data advocates and consumers. This relationship is driven by invoking a sensory input that generates a feeling, resulting in familiarity and trust among customers, triggering a decision.A few steps ensure effective content distribution are:Optimizing content Design:Your content may be the best, but the viewer has less time and many distractions. Setting up the right elements in the right place with the right words or graphics is a skill that once mastered can make any content successful. People want to know more about your solutions. Considering the value of time dynamics is important. It is important to create visually pleasing layouts that appeal to the viewer. You may lose a lead by just a scroll.Symbolization:Symbolizing the elements of the brand and communicating the same gives a product character, helping the views create an association with the product. Familiarity through association and credibility, therefore, leads to loyalty and choice over competitors. Visual impact can largely affect memory, which eventually determines decisions.Breaking the fourth wall:The fourth wall is a theatrical metaphor that separates the audience from the performers through an invisible curtain that is said to exist between the actor and the spectators. The fourth wall is broken when the narrator comes into the picture and directly engages with the audience. For B2B marketing, breaking the wall is necessary if leads are obtained in a relationship-based setting. Introducing a persona as a consultant to the tech services creates resonance and draws attention towards similar content from the same person.Give your story evidence:Storytelling is an art that creates a direct connection with viewers. A compelling story may be good, but a real story is solid. Storytelling in content marketing must have the virtues of empathy and resolution. These two factors keep a story going. Hence, supporting content with a story such as customer testimonials, product team problem-solution approaches can work wonders.Switch to visual:Once seen, it is easier to remember and retrieve the information. Visual memory is among the strongest memories, among smell, taste, and touch, which can sustain long term. While it is important to play with eye-catching content dynamics, auditory information is complementary. The idea is to move over from textual overload to an effortless visual experience. This experience sets the first parameter of engagement. It influences and intrigues. Visual cues can trigger both emotion and action.About the AuthorTorsha Ghosh \n\nManagement Trainee\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/marketing-technology-in-a-data-driven-era/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Data-Driven-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Data-Driven-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,,,Data-Driven,Management,Marketing,,,,,0
656327eaa3f6fc78b8eba1d6,-1880379081,Usability and Accessibility – How they are making AirGain smarter for you!,"October 5, 2021","Ever since the launch of the upgraded AirGain 2.0, we have been constantly making improvements by adding the features that can help airline revenue managers take faster and more accurate decisions in the new normal.Accurate pricing and faster decisions are the function of two key product tenets – usability and accessibility.Usability combines the user interaction with the system as well as how quickly can the user get the information that they need from the system. Our team constantly focuses on faster data delivery but also focuses on how quickly we can help our users understand this information.Accessibility is to ensure that there is no compromise in getting access to the right data any time of the day- This assumes more criticality as cyber security and hacks become part of our daily lives. It also becomes critical as we are delivering competitive data which is confidential for your decision making.Considering the above factors – our latest release allows our users to solve for the same and do much more.Lets understand the features in detail.Table of ContentsImproving Usability Through Schedule ViewOne of the major upgrades from Version 1, Schedule view on AirGain 2.0 lets users easily acquire flight schedule information and analyze it from within a single frame. The view is positioned as a separate tab on the AirGain app for easy access and has several intuitive controls that speed up the process of information acquisition.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-12-at-3.35.52-PM.jpg"" alt=""Airgain"" width=""1500"" height=""974"" />Collated Competitor Flight Data:Schedule View is a one-stop solution for revenue managers as well as pricing analysts to quickly draw up the list of flights operating on a given day, week, or any other fixed time duration. The users can search for all the scheduled flights of competitors for a particular OnD or even for multiple OnDs.This list includes comprehensive and up-to-date details about the flights including the operator, route, day, date, departure time, arrival time, flight duration, class, etc. This saves an enormous amount of time for the end-user, who does not have to spend time manually hunting for flight information on the web.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-12-at-3.50.19-PM-scaled.jpg"" alt=""AirGain"" width=""2560"" height=""1541"" />Downloadable Search Outcomes:Searches that have been performed on Schedule View can be downloaded both in a tabular format and a graphical format. From a data scientist’s perspective, the tabular format is ideal, as it provides granular level insights that can be used for the analysis of competitor behavior and to understand the flight load on a given day. Based on these analyses, your flight schedules can be tweaked or modified to give you better results than your competitors.The graphical view can be shared with the Senior Management for quick reference and guidance, as the data is presented as a visual overview allowing fast consumption and comprehension.Multiple Filters and Search Criteria:Another key addition to Schedule View is the ability to utilize pro-level filters while searching for flights. These filters include options like Flight Number, Carrier, Day of Week (DoW), Departure Date, and Departure Time.This allows the user to choose only the information that is relevant and required for that particular report, reducing the time taken to manually remove irrelevant search results.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.png"" alt=""AirGain Filters"" width=""1448"" height=""234"" />AccessibilityAirline pricing data is sensitive, and if this data falls into the wrong hands it could have negative repercussions. We have revamped AirGain’s User Access Management mechanisms to include robust features that save time, money and safeguard your data as well. This includes role-based access control, password self-change and configurability for email reports and time zones.Control What Others See Easily Earlier, everyone who logged in to the AirGain dashboard had the access to perform actions without restrictions. In case an analyst was to place an order on the platform by mistake, it could cost the company thousands of dollars. We realized that this is less than ideal, as not every user in the organization needs to have infinite unrestricted access to these features. By introducing access governance, or what we call Role-based Access Control (RBAC), the chances of feature misuse are nullified.Based on the three roles for accounts – Super Admin, Admin, and Analyst, only those who need access to a given feature would be able to use it.The Super Admin has total control of the account and can control what other users can see on the account. The Super Admin can also create, remove or modify users within a fraction of a second. For now, each account can have only one Super Admin, but this may change in the upcoming release.The Admin can perform elevated privilege tasks, which the regular users do not have access to. The Analyst can view and process Schedules, Graphs, and other statistical data to compile reports.Thus, role-based access can be provided to different groups of users, based on their specific work requirements.Say Goodbye to Tech Support As per a survey, 30-50% of IT helpdesk calls and requests are for password resets due to blocked/forgotten passwords. From a cost-to-organization perspective, this amounts to a sizeable $70 a day, which is $25,550 annually. While this may not seem to be a huge sum for a large organization, it is still an unnecessary expense that can be done away with.Through our Change Password functionality, users can now easily change or reset their passwords on their own, without having to depend on the IT team. This also lets users change passwords on the go, using their own devices, thereby reducing the risk of passwords getting exposed in case of a security breach.Right Report , Right TimeIf the reports are not generated in the correct format, it could cost the airline a lot of time and money. Having precise reports for a given slot, and being able to automate the sending of this report to a provided address can make the process easier for revenue managers. By streamlining AirGain, users can now configure the email addresses to which individual reports should go to.Localizing Time and CurrencyEarlier, a default time zone was set up on the account, across all users. Realizing the need to let different users have time schedules based on their location, we’ve introduced a feature where users can modify their default currency for fare analysis, as well as the time zones they are generating the reports for. This ensures that the report generation process is smooth, and there is no ambiguity in scheduling a report due to local time zone conversions.As can be seen above, the User Access Management features have been given a major revamp, putting the users in control of the data they are handling. This is just one step out of many which we have planned to make AirGain 2.0 as user-friendly as possible.Key Takeaways:If you’re interested in learning how AirGain is helping the fastest growing airlines, reach out to our experts for a free, no-commitment demo.About the Author Vikram Syal \n\nVice President – Product Management\n\nRateGainIn his current role, Vikram Syal leads the Engineering team at RateGain and drives the vision, strategy, and implementation of the integrated systems collaborating with sales, marketing, and other groups to support the ongoing process and customer deliveries.With an experience of 12+ years in various technological disciplines, he is a core product enthusiast, highly inquisitive, and detail-oriented innovative personnel.",https://rategain.com/blog/usability-and-accessibility-how-they-are-making-airgain-smarter-for-you/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Usability-and-Accessibility-How-they-are-making-AirGain-smarter-for-you.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Usability-and-Accessibility-How-they-are-making-AirGain-smarter-for-you.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-12-at-3.35.52-PM.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-12-at-3.50.19-PM-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Blog,,,AirGain,Airline,,,,,,0
656327eca3f6fc78b8eba1d8,1050636943,Building a Culture of Empowerment,"October 4, 2021","How can leaders drive change in the work culture?According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, 85% of the CEOs and CFOs say that an unhealthy culture will definitely lead to unethical behavior. Further, 9 out of 10 leaders believe that bringing a change in work culture will definitely help in improving the company’s value and performance in the long run. This underlines the fact that leaders acknowledge that an unhealthy culture can have a negative impact on the performance of both the company and its employees. In particular, the disparity in perceptions about the efficacy of the work culture between leaders and employees— leaders feel they are doing their utmost but employees feel they are not committed to improving work culture—can affect business outcomes.To fix such perceptions, leaders must quickly action changes to assure employees they can trust their leaders. A key change is ensuring employees are given the freedom to speak up about the company’s actions and policies, or offer project-related suggestions especially in the area of innovation. Leaders who recognize and acknowledge employee talent frequently, help boost motivation levels across the organization, nurture an empowered culture, and, in turn, productivity.Select the right candidate for the right job: Leaders must dig into their resource pool to pick candidates whose skills match the job or who can be motivated to hone or acquire the requisite skills. When employees are committed to their roles either because they are passionate about their work or because they feel they will earn recognition, a culture of empowerment is fostered.Maintain healthy relationships in the workplace: Developing healthy relationships is key to job satisfaction and tenure in an organization. Colleagues, team members, superiors, admin, HR—the employee’s experience is shaped by day-to-day interaction with all these people. To strengthen such relationships, leaders must drive celebrations, organize social gathering areas, team challenges, etc. Relationships can be nurtured at every level in the organization’s hierarchy. Communication, especially two-way communication, is another powerful tool to bolster relationships. Leaders, for example, can engage employees over a casual chat over coffee, or sports and social activities. This gives both parties a chance to get to know each other at a more personal level.Feedback: Feedback is important not just while building relationships, but also while assigning duties and responsibilities. When employees undertake responsibilities as part of a certain role they need constructive feedback on how they performed—where they excelled, where they lagged, what can be improved, etc. Asking for the EOD feedback is a good practice, that can ultimately boost employee productivity.Toward a motivated workforceThe work culture of an organization should be such that it empowers both the organization and its employees. Leaders must build a close connect with their people, listen to them, recognize and acknowledge their skills and talents, understand their values, and over time inculcate organizational values in their employees which helps them align with company goals, values, and culture. These are critical elements in building a strong work culture that empowers a diverse and motivated workforce.About the AuthorDhani Khanna \n\nManagement Trainee\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/building-a-culture-of-empowerment/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Building-a-Culture-of-Empowerment.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Building-a-Culture-of-Empowerment.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,Leaders,,Empowerment,Management,,,,,,0
656327eda3f6fc78b8eba1da,-1078576639,Is The Future Of Forecasting Clear For Revenue Managers?,"September 29, 2021","Revenue Managers would agree that car rental pricing is a tricky subject – Price your products too high, and the demand drops, price it too low, and you end up losing revenue. In such a case, it becomes essential to forecast demand by carefully analyzing multiple parameters such as fleet type, season, location, and more importantly, the Covid restrictions in place at that location.Has it become easier to analyze trends and determine the right price to rent the car – according to our analysis the answer is –NO. An analysis of the last six months tells us more.Table of ContentsDespite Traveler Intent Volatility PersistsAs per the data collected between March and September this year, there has been a major variation in the Average Daily Rates (ADR) and the Average Demand Index (ADI) for car rentals, with ADRs varying between $80 to $100. May had the highest outlier prices, while September was the most expensive month to rent a car. This was however expected, with recoveries in the market and the declining trend of new Covid cases ushering in renewed confidence among travelers.Data released by the American Automobile Association (AAA) shows that 75% of Georgians now feel more comfortable traveling as opposed to three months ago. 48 million Americans were expected to travel during the 4th of July holiday, which is historically the busiest time of the year for travel, regardless of the prevalent situation.While this was a situation that could have been capitalized on, available data shows that the price positioning has been nowhere close to optimal yield levels. Pricing was managed multiple times a day based on short-window changes in demand. By focusing on short-term utilization gains rather than a systematically planned pricing setup, operators have lost more than they have gained.Seasonality in demand can cause RMs to price their products inaccurately. Simply taking into consideration previous daily, weekly and monthly variations will not help. A collective analysis of real-time or near real-time data from multiple sources is what is essential for accurate forecasting.For example, Reuters has reported that due to the Delta variant of the Covid virus, the White House has decided to not lift travel restrictions for inbound travelers from Europe. If this news is not factored in while forecasting, the variation would be high as there are a sizeable number of travelers from Europe who visit America.To maximize revenues, there is a need for a pricing approach based predominantly on demand forecasting.Summer Prices in the US by Car TypeDemand and price variations are not just influenced by dates or time of travel, but also the car category that is chosen for travel. Data obtained for Summer 2021 in the top 10 cities of the US shows that the price alignment is not in sync with its demand trends and pricing.Most of the prices within 2 weeks of the booking date are being driven solely by competitor rates and not revenue potential. Even beyond the 14-day window, pricing is being decided on assumptions rather than systematically obtained forecast data.Trends show that competitiveness in pricing based on the market took precedence over demand assessment. By focusing on being cheaper than their competitor, car rental businesses have lost easy revenue arising out of demand.Compact cars were priced the cheapest in Boston and were most expensive in Atlanta. The ADR variation for this segment was massive, ranging between $70 and $142.Economy cars too displayed a major variance in the ADR, with a range of $70 to $158. Orlando and Houston had the lowest prices while New York was the most expensive.Midsize cars ranged between $72 and $152 in terms of ADR and were the cheapest in Orlando and most expensive in Boston.Standard-sized cars had an ADR between $78 and $167, with Miami having the cheapest rental price and Chicago being the most expensive.For the Full-size car segment, the ADRs ranged between $82 and $161, again with Orlando being the cheapest and Las Vegas being the most expensive.In the Premium car segment, ADR stood between $105 and $210. Houston and Orlando were the cheapest locations to rent a premium car, whereas Chicago was the most expensive.With regard to price variation for all car types, a common trend observed was the highs being 2x or more of the lows. In general, Orlando was the cheapest location for car rentals in most categories except compact and standard.Summer Prices in the US by ZonesIn addition to categorizing demand based on car type, we analyzed the price-demand data based on zones in the US. Additionally, Covid-related statistics such as the number of new cases per day and the adult vaccination rates in the chosen region were taken into consideration. This analysis includes forecasts for October and November, in addition to existing data for August and September.For the Eastern Seaboard Zone, the Average Closing Utilization (ACU) for a 2-week booking window stood at 74%, while the Average Cancellation Trend (ACT) stood at 24%. Interestingly, the utilization levels recorded here were higher than that of 2019. On the flip side, however, all the pricing parameters after 1st October 2021 are opposite to the demand indices in the city, with higher rates being charged on days with low demand. The rate of increase of Covid cases is not as steep as other major cities, so it should have a low impact on the forecasting for the coming weeksFor Orlando, the 2-week ACU stood at 78% while the ACT was 23%. The pricing parameters between 5th September to 1st October are majorly opposite to the demand indices in the city, with lower rates being charged on days with high demand. Covid cases are on a steep rise here, which could result in improper forecasting due to last-minute changes in travel plans or local regulations.In Miami, the 2-week ACU was 84% with an ACT of 22%. The pricing parameters for September and October are majorly opposite to the demand indices in the city, with lower rates being charged on days with high demand. Covid cases are on a very steep rise, which could result in last-minute demand fluctuations.For the Central US zone, 2-week ACU stood at 91% and the ACU was a mere 13%. The utilization and cancellation trends here are much better than in all the other zones. The pricing parameters from the last week of September to the second week of November are majorly opposite to the demand indices in the city, with higher rates being charged on days with low demand. Despite a steady rise in Covid cases, the forecasting is unlikely to get affected to a great extent.In the Pacific Coast, 2-week ACU was at 81% with an ACT of 16%. In this zone, price competitiveness is taking prominence over the availability of demand, resulting in a loss of revenue. The ADR can easily be improved by 10% even while maintaining the same utilization. Covid cases are on an increasing trend, and thus could slightly affect the forecasting.For San Francisco, a 2-week ACU of 81% and an ACT of 19% were observed. The slow rate of new Covid infections recorded is unlikely to affect the forecasting much.However, despite all these trends, it is important to note that higher utilization alone does not guarantee a higher revenue, as the average daily rates also need to be taken into consideration. Higher utilization with a lower ADR means significantly lesser revenues than lower utilization with higher ADR.Demand-Price ElasticityTo better price car rentals, Revenue Managers need to consider demand-price elasticity. Lower demand-price elasticity means that price changes do not affect demand much. Higher demand-price elasticity means demand sharply changes as the price changes. Thus, in places with higher price elasticity, revenue managers need to be careful while pricing to get the maximum utilization as well as revenue. In places with lower demand-price elasticity values, RMs can increase rates to maximize revenues without worrying about reduced occupancy.It was observed that Demand-Price elasticity increased correspondingly from low to very high as the size of the car increased. In terms of locations, Atlanta, Miami, and San Francisco showed higher Demand-Price elasticities while Orlando and Las Vegas showed lower elasticity.What is the future?Car rental companies tend to make pricing decisions based on their gut feelings, or on outdated trends, which often leads to loss of revenue opportunities. This can be fixed by proper demand forecasting, which helps identify demand patterns and set price points smartly. That way you can be sure that you’re always charging what your customers will be able to pay.Utilizing technology, you can identify fluctuations in pricing based on seasonality or other parameters thus predicting accurately how much each customer would be willing to spend before they even book their rental!Our experts at RateGain will help you calculate the forecast from 25 demand indicators, each of which provides the right insights at the right time, ensuring that every forecast helps you maximize your profits.About the Author Siddhartha Kothari\n\nExec.VP & General Manager- Artificial Intelligence\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/is-the-future-of-forecasting-clear-for-revenue-managers/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Is-The.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Is-The.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Blog,,,COVID 19,Revenue Management,Revenue Managers,,,,,0

The recently concluded summer season in the US saw travelers returning to the hotels. Recovery has begun, in pockets, where vaccination programs are in full swing. Recently, the US has confirmed that they are easing restrictions for fully vaccinated travelers globally. The impact of the crisis is undoubtedly, but slowly, subsiding. Hoteliers face a unique set of questions and challenges; after a lull of 18 months, consolidation, selling inventory, and profit optimization are on top of their minds.Table of ContentsThe Need for Room – Rate Management API RateGain is committed to expediting recovery for the industry. In collaboration with Booking.com, the world’s topmost OTA, we will soon be launching Booking.com’s Room –Rate management API, a part of Product API that enables management of Room – Rate combinations promoted on booking.com from within the channel manager’s UI.The business case for this API has surfaced a lot, especially post-covid, as hoteliers are looking to drive maximum occupancy. The API will unburden hoteliers from signing into different systems – channel manager followed by Booking.com extranet – for creating room rates and pushing the same in the OTA for consumers to consume.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rate-Management-API.png"" alt=""Rate Management API"" width=""1625"" height=""941"" />Launching Room-Rate Management Capability from RezGainBy using the Room – Rate Management API, distribution teams can directly and quickly create/retrieve a multitude of room rates types from RezGain UI – without separately signing into the Booking.com extranet each time.

656327f0a3f6fc78b8eba1de,1549043543,How Revenue Managers Can Be Future Ready For The Next Crisis,"September 23, 2021","There are two stories of travel recovery that we are witnessing right now in the United States. During the summer of 2021 hotels everywhere witnessed an overwhelming number of tourists who came back to enjoy a well deserved summer break. We all heard stories of how some destinations ran out of rental cars and hotels were at full occupancy with ADR and bookings bucking all previous trends in a traditionally low-demand season. The fall out of this surge has been the sharp rise in hospitalizations across states that have low vaccination rates when compared to the national average.Whatever it is, volatility remains the theme of the season as we move towards recovery making it challenging for revenue managers to plan for the future. However, what is key here is to define how we look at the future. In my understanding there are two futures – the one that needs immediate attention and the one we need to plan for.The future we all discuss is not just the next quarter or next six months – but a future where volatility will increasingly become a part of revenue management as we tackle global disruptions on a daily basis. This includes changes in not only traveler behavior, but also resources available at the supply side; local restrictions; international events and more. Nothing can be predicted with certainity and this forces revenue management teams to be in a continous evolution mode.Right pricing is slowly becoming a big piece of the puzzle – as optimizing strategies to accommodate rise and decline in demand can have adverse impact on margins. So is there a way to handle both the futures?Table of ContentsThe Immediate Future: Tackling Volatility EverydayA breakthrough innovation that is already making a lot of noise among revenue leaders is MarketDRONE Narratives. It is more than a data analyzing tool – it helps Revenue Managers become better at their job.Market volatility is a reality. Tackling it manually, sourcing data and deriving insights from it isn’t just tedious but it strips critical hours from a revenue manager’s life that could have been invested in realizing revenue maximizing.Get clear and actionable insights every time there is a change in the market – helping revenue and pricing managers know exactly how to position one’s revenue strategies for the day, while mitigating any loss of market share and increasing RevPAR – saving critical hours spent in collating and analyzing data.MarketDRONE Narratives feeds on a data lake, using a mix of distribution and market supply data combined with competitive rate shopping data across Hotels and OTAs. Learn more.Commenting on it, Harmeet Singh, CEO, RateGain said “As one of the largest aggregators of data in our industry, RateGain is committed to listening to our customers who have clearly stated the need to evolve rate intelligence solutions. MarketDRONE Narratives is a step in that direction where we continue to push innovation and help our customers move faster every day to unlock more revenue.The Long-term vision: Making the Future of Travel clear At RateGain, our team has been obsessing over these challenges for months – it has heralded an array of exciting innovations like Demand-AI. Imagine if marketing or distribution teams could foretell the source and place of the upcoming surge in demand in a particular locality! What if they could forecast in advance the dates when demand will be the highest?Wouldn’t it make more sense business-wise to know what kind of guest will potentially be visiting your city? Indeed, these insights would be mission-critical for any hotel or hospitality business to drive revenues and improve ROI. A highly targeted, data-driven and geo-specific campaign would show better results vis-a-vis a campaign without this intelligence – it helps you get more ROI on your ad spend.The industry’s first AI-powered index uses over 25 forward looking real-time demand indicators and does not rely on historical data to give you the exact picture of demand for the next 75 days in a city. No plug-ins and no configuration required. Just sign up and start planning ahead.At the same time, it offers hoteliers an opportunity to direct their resources towards the best guest experience by planning ahead. You can See it for yourself by signing up for Demand.AI<iframe title=""YouTube video player"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qadlvXGdmAk"" width=""900"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>Demand-AI serves a bigger purpose though. In the words of our founder Bhanu Chopra, “I am proud of my team today as we launch Demand.AI, a product created and conceptualized, end-to-end by RateGain, to make the future of travel clear and provide insights for the next 75 days at a hyper local level, helping businesses with critical insights to not only recovery but also create sustainable jobs.”What lies ahead I feel we are still some time away from realizing full recovery. Our industry is sitting on volumes of data –making it more accessible for revenue managers and distribution teams would be the real gamechanger. The need of the hour is predictive data and technologies, as past data has been rendered almost ineffective. While this crisis leapfrogged us in the new digital age, the future belongs to those who adopt these technologies. What’s stopping you?I’d love to hear your thoughts on this exciting theme and would like to showcase these technologies LIVE in action. As I hit the road once again to meet industry experts – reach out to me at any of these events to see the products in action: Skift Global Forum, HITEC Dallas  and HSMAI ROC this September in Dallas or at HEDNA – Miami in October.

656327f3a3f6fc78b8eba1e0,-594688326,How Can New Airlines Thrive the Post- Covid World,"September 3, 2021","The airline sector by itself is challenging, and the pandemic just made it more so. Leading airlines are plagued by steep reductions in occupancy levels, fluctuating demand, and the absence of solid, reliable historical data to back pricing decisions.It is not going to be easy for new airlines, but that hasn’t stopped aviation entrepreneurs from trying. As per data from a recent study, in 2021 alone, more than 90 new airlines are set to launch operations, across low-cost and premium categories.[1]\nThis is great news and a much-needed boost for an industry that has been struggling to record growth in the past 18 months. However, these airlines do not have a lot of time to settle in and build customer acquisition strategies. In order to sustain and develop, these airlines would require a product that can start delivering from the get-go.Setting up the perfect revenue management plan is tricky. More so in the case of new airlines, several other challenges need to be factored in. Automating certain tasks such as the acquisition of fresh, usable data through a SaaS product can simplify the entire process, letting RMs focus on maximizing revenue.In this article, we’ve compiled some helpful tips for RMs of new airline companies to enable them to thrive in a highly competitive market.Challenges in the Aviation IndustryChallenges faced by New Airlines\n\nUnlike established airlines that already enjoy brand loyalty, new airlines have an uphill task to create a brand recall in the minds of travelers. Not knowing what channels work for marketing can make this process difficult.In terms of pricing, newer airlines are unsure of the right price point, and some tend to adopt deep discounting, which apart from being unsustainable in the long run, could affect the brand image.Knowing the target audience in terms of what traveler is right for the airlines, and what is the price they are willing to pay is essential, but without real-time data, it would be hard for new airlines to get right in the first go.How new airlines can make a mark from day one\n\nAirlines need to rethink the traditional methods of acquiring data, as most of the available data in the currently volatile market is rendered useless within a matter of hours. Due to the ever-changing regulations and travel advisories in the wake of Covid, it is essential for RMs to:However, these tasks would require a lot of time and effort if done manually. Time is a luxury which new airlines cannot afford, as established airlines are already utilizing technology to get real-time insights that help them price smartly. Revenue managers of new airlines have to first focus on setting up a brand name and positioning themselves in the market. This in itself is a huge task, which cannot be side-lined simply because the RMs are following the old approach of manually acquiring rates.The advantages of automationThere may be no magic wand to undo the damage Covid has caused but using a tool that is designed keeping in mind the ever-changing industry can assist revenue managers in making intelligent decisions that can help new airlines prosper.Real-time, any time\n\nLack of real-time data can strongly affect pricing decisions. Relevant data needs to be compiled from a variety of sources in real-time so that RMs can constantly track price changes and stay updated on the latest trends.Faster insights, to always stay ahead\n\nReal-time data just forms one part of the solution. Utilizing tools or processes that allow revenue managers configure a set of rules based on certain criteria such as departure dates, routes, fare differences, channels, and return parameters can help them plan prices smarter. Additionally, parameters that trigger alerts in case of a variation in the configured criteria can be set up.Possessing actionable insights lets you make decisions faster than your competitors, giving you a major advantage in the pricing game.Compare prices across channels\n\nA robust platform is one that lets you identify and compare variations in mobile and desktop prices, before making pricing decisions. This lets you maximize revenues by pricing your offering intelligently.Easy and efficient platform management\n\nAny digital platform or tool used for acquiring, analyzing or interpreting data should be easy to use and have features that let the users perform repeated actions in a single click, thus saving time.For example, if a dataset is common across multiple reports, having to enter the data individually into these reports would be extremely time consuming and contrary to the thought process involved in using that software in the first place.\n\nWith a tool that can automate a certain task, such as addition, modification or deletion of data across multiple reports within a few clicks, RMs can save time and effort easily.Reports form a vital part of the revenue management and pricing processes in the airline industry. Large amounts of data need to be processed and presented in an easy-to-comprehend format, often multiple times a day. This can cause a lot of reports to pile up, making it cumbersome to manage and sort based on the RMs requirement.In a data-driven world where split second decisions are taken based on freshly available data, new airlines cannot be left lagging behind with stale, inaccurate data. New airlines need to act immediately to implement systems that acquire high-accuracy real-time data.Pricing intelligence for new airlines\n\nNew airlines have much more work cut out for them to succeed in a highly competitive market. While the challenges are aplenty, a comprehensive solution like AirGain can solve all pricing intelligence related issues.Modern challenges require modern solutions. Old methods of rate shopping will get you nowhere. It’s time to consider new ways of gaining rate intelligence. Let AirGain take care of your pricing decisions, while you focus on operations.

656327f7a3f6fc78b8eba1e4,1271487781,CarGain Canvas: Analytics that give you 360 degree control over your market,"September 1, 2021","In the new normal, competitive pricing is everything – It could be the difference between a massive boost in sales or break your revenue forecast completely. Unless your product is competitively priced, it can lead to potential revenue loss in terms of losing customers. However, competitive pricing is a double-edged sword, as cut-throat pricing in the quest for revenue can cause a decline in operating profits.This puts pricing and revenue managers in a tough spot, as they have to take carefully ascertained calls on pricing. Doing this process manually is time-consuming, with millions of rows of data to sieve through. With no indicators of real-time demand changes and fleet utilization statistics, the RMs cannot ascertain which fleet type is more/less in demand.As the revenue managers are not aware of what bookings they have coming up, they tend to end up pricing wrongly. This means that on days that the bookings are low, the prices could be on the higher side and underpriced when the bookings are high. As they are unaware on the length of the rentals, they may be unable to optimize their fleets as well.Table of ContentsCarGain Canvas, RateGain’s most sought-after offering addresses these issues with an intuitive analytics dashboard.Fixing the pricing challengeSome of the challenges that revenue managers in the car industry face include:As an integrated analytics solution that provides a 360-degree market view on pricing and other aspects, Canvas helps revenue managers through volatile demand by identifying potential revenue loss, verifying market positions, and rectifying the pricing strategy for every market. All these combined, help RMs unlock unexplored streams of revenue in the new normal, thus eliminating uncertainty.CarGain Canvas is the first and currently the only such platform in the car rental industry which features advanced yet easy-to-use filters that can help analyze both historical trends and track market changes instantly by monitoring booking pace and tracking utilization to get a comprehensive, overarching view of the market.Simplified dashboard with advanced featuresWith Canvas, you can save time by automating market position analysis using a single-screen dashboard that provides granular level market insights. Multiple visualization formats are available, including historical trends for best-performing parameters, all in a unified window for easy access.Understandably, due to the pandemic, historical data may not always be an ideal indicator of future trends. Knowing this fact, Canvas uses causal analytics as the base to provide pricing teams actions they should take based on real-time market updates.Identify – Verify – Rectify!Using the CarGain Canvas is pretty simple. Pricing and revenue managers can follow a three-pronged approach to solving their pricing challenges.First up, the profitable opportunities need to be identified by analyzing easily accessible competitor data that includes hundreds of billions of competitor rates.Using the Filter tool, you can get granular level insights for various data categories such as Car Type, Competition Type, Location, LOR, and Mileage.The Toggle tool lets you switch views based on Shop Name, Country, PoS, Payment, and Sources for faster and accurate interpretation of market data.With multiple price variance visualization formats available to choose from, you can group the data in the form of Calendars, Graphs, or Tabs.Once you have identified the key data indicators, you now need to verify these triggers that impact demand. With just a click, you can access a tool called Pace Chart, which compares the past and present performance of you and your competitors. Real-time insights regarding demand catalysts, mode of travel, and other high-level business KPIs are easily viewable as Summary Snapshots in multiple formats for better comprehension and monitoring.Lastly, Canvas helps rectify pricing decisions (up to 10 times faster than manual methods) by never letting you miss a price change. Real-time alerts notify you of any market changes or opportunities, thereby helping you stay up-to-date with ever-changing trends in the post-covid world.This is possible by employing an engine that delivers super-fast analytics and generates insights of rental price data sorting it with color-coding by delta or variance, as required. The dashboard also provides quick access to the evolution of fares, helping you rectify pricing mistakes on the go. Most importantly, all the historical competitive price intelligence data gets stored on our high-performance servers with unlimited access and storage capacity.

656327f9a3f6fc78b8eba1e6,-1703061865,What Signals is the Summer of 2021 Giving Car Rentals?,"July 8, 2021","2020 is a year that the car rental industry would want to forget. The pandemic and the challenges it brought in terms of lockdowns and social distancing had the industry witnessing an unprecedented slump. Fortunately, with the development of the Covid-19 vaccine, demand for car rentals is now gradually picking up.With the US accelerating vaccination efforts combined with the ease in travel restrictions, we are witnessing a spike in travel activity across the US and North American markets. There is an increased demand for domestic trips, vacation rentals, and staycations, with many people opting for interstate travel. By analyzing the trends of the past few months, revenue managers can effectively plan better revenue strategies for forecasted demand.Car rental demand saw an upsurge in most of the cities in the US and Canada. We are witnessing higher pricing arising out of lesser supply, spurred by the fleet and car inventory shortage. This brings about inevitable price volatility, which is hard to anticipate and plan for without advanced analysis and pricing automation.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/graph_01.jpg"" alt=""ADR Future Trend"" width=""1200"" height=""449"" />Table of ContentsHow is Summer Looking for Car Rentals?Prices for summer rentals look more expensive in the US, with an average of 20-30% increase in the rates for daily ADRs. However, Canada is following a more linear growth path for ADR prices.Most of the areas in the US have plateaued and settled down on pricing that is somewhat aggressive compared to Canada and other locales. Summer demand seems to have peaked in the US, with averages of around 180 dollars on ADR, higher than the peak in Aug 2019. Comparatively, the summer demand isn’t yet getting that sharp spike in Canada.With this rising demand, rental companies are trying to maximize their revenues through a fleet size similar to previous years. This has resulted in aggregated utilization of over 95% in the top 25 locations of the US market. The overall utilization calendar is around 70% and looks poised to continue that way unless the industry jointly takes corrective steps.It would be interesting to see how revenue managers try and find ways to increase the revenue based on demand for the pre-existing fleet. To better understand pricing factors, we need to analyze car rental price variations based on location and car type.The last-minute prices for Canada are considerably low when compared to the farther out dates, which have prices on the higher side. For the US, however, the last-minute prices are way higher, across all pickup dates spread over four months up unto October.Volatile Locations Across the US and CanadaCar Rental Trends on the US East Coast\n\n<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/graph_02.jpg"" alt=""ADR Future Trend"" width=""1200"" height=""443"" />Akin to the national trend, the prices in Newark, EWR, and New York, JFK witnessed an increase as the booking date approached, followed by a two-week dip, which then stabilized for a 3–4-month period.<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/graph_03.jpg"" alt="""" />\n\nAtlanta, ATL, and Boston, BOS had a different picture to show, with revenue managers opting for static pricing for future dates, due to the lower yield from demand.Car Rental Trends on the US West Coast\n\n<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/graph_04.jpg"" alt=""ADR Future Trend"" width=""1200"" height=""327"" />Interestingly on the West Coast, key cities Los Angeles, LAX, Las Vegas, LAS, and San Francisco, SFC kept the price flag on the higher side, with San Francisco opting for a 25% higher price flag compared to LAX and LAS.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/graph_05.jpg"" alt=""ADR Future Trend"" width=""1200"" height=""321"" />In the Florida region, Miami, MIA had a few summer dates with huge spikes, with on-demand pricing crossing 160 dollars as ADR.

Toronto, YYZ, however, has shown a lot of price volatility with prices going down drastically closer to the booking dates and peaking out at around 2 months with an average of close to 250 dollars.The overall market outlook in Canada leans towards reduced prices closer to the booking date. Pricing volatility and uncertain demand pose a challenge for revenue managers and car rental operators while pricing the far-out dates, on whether to price it higher or at a range similar to the lower rates closer to the booking date. For June, car rental prices look 20% cheaper when compared to the same timeframe last year.Car Rental Pricing Insights for other markets\n\nRateGain has collated a similar list of such statistics and insights for other markets as well, which we would be happy to share with our clients. Contact us via email or call for more information on how you can come aboard with us.Which Car Categories should you Focus onIt is impractical to arrive at a pricing decision based solely on the rate insights of a given location. Revenue managers need to consider the type of car rented out, as pricing most often varies across the different car categories. Here are some market insights based on car types that should help car rental companies set up better pricing points.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincomstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/graph_07.jpg"" alt=""ADR Future Trend"" width=""1200"" height=""617"" />Owing to the pandemic, the shortage in supply of electronic chips for intermediate and full-size cars resulted in lower car availability in this segment.

To have a sense of security and be upheld as an equally deserving individual in the work environment enables us to battle for LGBTQ2IA+ rights both inside and outside of associations.The intensity of pride people feel for an act or trait is set by an implicit mental map of what others value, according to new research (https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/).

656327fca3f6fc78b8eba1ea,-1322932144,Bringing More Speed and Agility to Airline Pricing for the Post-COVID Revenue Manager,"June 15, 2021","In every conversation with a customer, one key conversation we have with them is to understand if AirGain 2.0 made it easier for them to not only test their pricing strategies but also made it faster and agile to make changes to the system.One challenge we are looking to solve for since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is to be able to address volatility in the fastest way possible and make it easier for revenue as well as pricing teams to make changes.Table of ContentsIntroducing One Click Report Changes\n\nFor the first time in the industry, we are addressing a very common problem that can save hours of effort. Most pricing teams struggle with editing multiple records in case of addition of a data set that is common to all reports, having to update every report individually making the task mundane and without any real ROI.Using the bulk update feature, revenue managers can now save hours of effort and mental peace by updating all reports with a single click. Now adding a new OND or editing an existing departure date across different reports becomes super easy and efficientThe user can simply select the reports they wish to simultaneously update, and then add, edit or delete Origin and Destination (OND), Departure Dates, Channels and SchedulePost entering the new values or making the corrections to these options as desired, the user will have to press ‘Update’ for the changes to be updated and reflected on all the reports previously selected by the user.Combined with the new module for report generation which has been updated for enhanced speeds and usability, bulk update lets you experience flexibility and fine tweaking, unlike any other SaaS.Ultimately, with the use of Bulk Update, many work-hours can be saved in the long run, leading to better efficiency and better resource optimizationAgile ReportingGetting faster access to reports and the ability to manage them was a critical requirement of all of our customers. In AirGain 2.0 report generation is now enhanced and provides the users with a seamless and hassle-free experience of acquiring reports by themselves, without the need for intervention by customer success teams.Report generation has been reworked from the ground up to offer enhanced loading speeds compared to the earlier version, easier ways to create, view, edit, and clone reports as well as methods to bump up the priority of a given report. The stop-pause report feature has also been included in the new report generation module in AirGain 2.0.The clone reports feature helps in quickly creating another copy of a selected report, which is ideal in cases where there is a need for two similar reports with minor changes or differences.The bulk update feature as mentioned earlier makes it easy to manage multiple reports in one go, reducing the cumbersome task of manually sieving through countless reports to update or correct a single data entry.There are no limits on the number of reports a user can generate, and all these reports can be individually customized to the specific needs of the user. These reports can also be sorted and filtered to display exactly what the user needs, without having to manually go through every report that may not be relevant to the specific requirement at a given time.While these features may not be something unique as compared to other solutions in the market, what differentiates them is the ease of use and reduced dependence on technical assistance for report generation as well as modification. All these features are being offered as a part of the entire AirGain package without additional charges to the user.An Array of Features to Make Revenue Management Easier\n\nWith features like MarketSense and Bulk Update, which are key industry differentiators, the users can experience a solution that is comprehensive in all regards.Market Sense, which is also integrated into AirGain 2.0, is a customizable module that lets airline revenue managers set up specific rules based on options such as ONDs, departure dates, channels, fares, etc. This would help them get real-time actionable insights and improve their revenue margins.\n\nData shown in AirGain 2.0 is sourced from over 200 tracked airlines, 50 METAs, 170 OTAs, and 700+ websites to ensure a constant flow of updated information that is readily available for revenue managers and pricing teams to act upon. Newer sources are added regularly after proper verification of the data being acquired.AirGain 2.0 – What Every RM Needs!\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our team at AirGain constantly strives to better the product with each iteration, ensuring that our customers get the best airfare pricing solution currently present in the market.If you’re not already convinced about the abilities of AirGain 2.0, get in touch with our expert advisors for a free demo of our custom-made solution for the airline industry.

656327fda3f6fc78b8eba1ec,-557313928,The Current State of Airline Pricing post-Covid,"May 3, 2021","The sheer suddenness of the Covid-19 pandemic thrust businesses across sectors into a deep downward spiral. Granted, it has been over a year since Covid first hit us, and that a vaccine is now available across the world. However, the ripple effect is yet to subside.While businesses are slowly getting back on to their feet, they are met with the fear and apprehension prevalent among their customers. None else is more affected than the travel and tourism sector, which by virtue of being a non-essential luxury is finding it hard to regain its earlier glory.Table of ContentsThe civil aviation sector and its path to recoveryWith the number of new Covid-19 cases in most countries witnessing a downward trend, also aided by the fact that most countries are now gradually relaxing the restrictions that were previously imposed, people are slowly venturing out of their comfort zones and opting to take up both domestic and international travel.Robin Chiang, General Manager (EMEA) for KAYAK, an international online travel agency and metasearch engine has been closely tracking the advances in the travel sector with a specific focus on airline travel. He observes that the travel trip duration has changed from pre-covid times, with people spending longer times on international travel. He attributes this to the mandatory quarantine measures in place in most destination countries, which in turn extends the duration of the vacationer’s trip.Another key factor that plays a role in longer trip durations is the reduced costs of vacationing stemming from hotels that are running on low occupancy and hence providing better deals and savings to the traveler, prompting them to stay longer.While inter-regional travel duration spiked due to the Covid restrictions in place, the intra-regional travel duration remained almost unchanged for most locales including North America (NORAM), Latin America (LATAM), and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions. However, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) reported a slight variation with decreased durations in the summer arising from loosened restrictions.On the pricing front, most regions reported a fall in prices for inter-regional travel due to supply-demand disparity. EMEA again was the exception, presumably because airline operators had to follow stringent distancing norms, resulting in a massive reduction of operating capacity.Another phenomenon that was observed was the massive increase in last-minute travel, with opportunistic booking based on pricing and impending regulatory changes.Users are engaging more frequently with KAYAK’s Flexible Filters and Covid Hub. The former helps users determine which flights can be flexibly rescheduled without getting penalized, which is the need of the hour considering the general air of uncertainty surrounding covid-related travel. Covid Hub, on the other hand, shows a daily updated map of 215 countries and their corresponding travel restrictions in place due to Covid. This has gained recognition from Forbes as one of the most reliable sources of travel restriction information.Newly emerging user patternsApart from the points mentioned earlier, users are also looking at sustainable and environmentally friendly flight options, thus making it necessary for flight operators to be multimodal in their approach towards pricing and availability.Workcations: Owing to the changed work policies that allow employees to work remotely, people are now looking at vacationing in a new light. With countries like Bermuda offering ‘Work from abroad’ visas, as well as domestic travel and stay becoming more affordable, workcationing is slowly gaining traction, thereby opening a new opportunity for ailing airlines and hotels.Rental Cars: With concerns of health and sanitation, more and more people prefer a single means of conveyance while on vacation. This has resulted in an upsurge in the number of rental cars being booked for long periods.Online Travel Agencies vs. Direct Operator Ticketing: Chiang feels that there has been no major change in the patterns concerning user’s choice of booking portals.Desktop vs. Mobile booking: Again, Chiang observes that there has been no major shift in the preferred medium of booking.Airline market patterns and volatilityPost the holiday season, airlines have seen a sharp dip in revenue which can be attributed to stringent restrictions being put in place by most countries. Resultantly, airline fares dipped drastically in January and February.Most Origin and Destination (ONDs) that are showing a downward trend are from the Europe region, which has seen the highest number of restrictions being put in place, specifically to curb the second and third waves of the pandemic.The most volatile routes in terms of fares for the past 6 months were in the Europe, China, and India region, thus prompting airline revenue managers in these locales to look at and adjust the pricing in real-time.Such volatility is expected to continue until 2022, where pent-up demand spikes will continue to be observed during periods of restriction relaxation. To combat this, it is essential to revisit forecast techniques by requesting for leading indicators data from reliable providers, which can help predict these demand spikes.Also, with domestic travel being key to recovery, airlines need to focus more on the ancillaries.Technology and digital transformation to the rescue?Brian Wishlinski, Director – Partners and Alliances from PROS, an AI-powered dynamic pricing provider working closely with RateGain, courtesy of a recent partnership, feels that revenue management systems and technology need to be updated to tackle volatility in the current scenario.With last-minute bookings on the rise, airlines are looking for new sources of data to predict demand and adjust fares accordingly. Supply is probably recovering faster than demand, which makes it imperative for revenue managers to anticipate demand based on external factors such as countries removing restrictions.“In such recovery situations, rapid changes are seen in the pricing environment. This makes competitive intelligence information like that provided by RateGain much more important than ever and to be able to integrate that data with your revenue management solution is invaluable, especially for fare analysts.” opines Brian.Airlines are now using this recovery phase as a ground to be innovative. Concepts like dynamic and continuous pricing provide the airline with extended flexibility in terms of additional price points in the pricing curve.\n\nThrough dynamic offers, real-time shopping and pricing options can be provided to the customers, offering them an elevated experience. Airlines also need to step up their digital and eCommerce solutions to capture more of the customer’s wallet share by becoming their one-stop solution for all requirements.Historical data, which once used to be the mainstay of revenue managers while deciding on the pricing is now virtually rendered useless. The traditional means of pricing based on time to departure is now irrelevant because most of the bookings seen in the post-covid scenario are being made in a shorter, condensed booking window of a few hours or days at most.“Revenue management teams are struggling with the lack of data sources to predict demand and consequently price flights. It is important to leverage the combined knowledge of the RM and the pricing team to align with the overall goals. It is important that all teams involved remain agile through this phase.” says Ciaran Brannigan, Ex-director of Revenue, RyanAir.In conclusion, airlines need to be flexible to deal with the bumpy ride that awaits them on the irrefutable path to recovery.About the Author Shweta Vashishth \n\nSenior Vice President – Sales\n\nRateGainIn her current role, Shweta Vashishth leads the travel business solutions at RateGain.

656327ffa3f6fc78b8eba1ee,251689039,How can hoteliers get 2021 right with a solid pricing strategy as volatility in recovery persists,"May 3, 2021","The past year has been brutal for the travel and hospitality industry. COVID has caused unforeseen damage – with plummeting revenues for hotels and airlines. However, things are gradually heading towards a new normal, albeit with a few hiccups.For starters, vaccination programs worldwide are driving down the number of cases, while slowly bringing back the lost confidence in public to undertake journeys that they have been withholding due to fears of contracting or spreading the virus. On this front, Israel is leading the way globally alongside the UAE and US in ensuring their citizens get their jab at the earliest.Table of ContentsVolatility in recovery In December, China saw a significant spike in bookings – which can be attributed to the anticipation of start of recovery. However, towards the end of Q4, FY20-21 – and the beginning of Q1, FY2021-22 – the numbers again witnessed a downward trend due to the surge in cases. A similar trend has been observed in India as well, with the start of a decline in cases in Q4, FY2020-21 prompting an increase in bookings, but presently being overshadowed with the large number of cases being unearthed.However, for the European market, the recovery has been slow, with consistent downward trends being observed in bookings. The US has been a shining light – with rapid recovery observed due to solid curbs in exports of their homegrown vaccine and effective implementation of swift vaccination mechanisms.As a whole, the scenario is very volatile. While specific markets showing promising recovery signs, the others have shown little to no positive trends yet. The public sentiment toward travel is seen directly correlating to the increase and decrease in cases, and understandably so. Safety always comes first.The Summer looks promisingHowever, the weeks of Summer 2021 are looking promising in terms of booking sentiment across many parts of the world – especially weeks 20, 21, and 22. Aggressive vaccination programs, pent-up demand resulting from the inability to travel, and ease in restrictions are a few factors that are pointing towards these trends.For instance, Germany is set to welcome 137% more travelers during week 21 as compared to week 20. At the same time, Indonesia is hoping to celebrate Eid with more vigor, unlike in 2020. Thus, recovery seems to be on the horizon.Changing traveler expectations and patterns to watch out forWith the restrictions and curbs still in place across several parts of the world, travelers are going for domestic travel compared to international travel. This situation is expected to change once the number of cases drops significantly and the restrictions are eased.In terms of trends, travelers are booking only specific accommodations and flights where they can easily cancel or change their plans without incurring an additional fee or a very minimal to a negligible cost.They prefer properties that are competitively priced and have discount offers. They are also booking well in advance to take advantage of early bird offers and lower prices. These trends directly impact how pricing managers decide their strategies.Booking.com’s CEO, Glenn D. Fogel, has a piece of advice for travelers: prices right now are very competitive – it only makes sense to book for the upcoming travel in advance. Since most airlines and hotels offer free cancelation, there is nothing that a traveler would lose if they make an early booking. The time to book is now because once the pandemic is done and dusted, it is more than likely that there would be a huge influx of globetrotters escaping to destinations, causing prices to shoot up massively.Key industry insights towards handling the new normalDriving a successful pricing strategy in 2021To drive a successful pricing strategy, forward-looking data would be extremely essential, as old and historical data have been rendered almost irrelevant after the pandemic in 2020. People were also looking for search analysis data based on which they were choosing popular destinations in 2020, that are safe to visit even with the global scare of Covid.Industry reaction to change in customer expectations“We are in three crises at the same time. Health crisis. Financial crisis because of the corona. Crisis of confidence – as bookings and travel have almost stopped. Shift from international to domestic escapes has lowered business volumes for international providers. Promotions for the local customer has been the norm for now.” says Fritz Muller, VP – Enterprise Clients, RateGain.Customers need more information regarding the whole process – from booking hotels and flights to local information regarding applicable restrictions. Hotels and travel companies are slowly adapting to the need for additional content.“The guest right now wants flexibility in terms of travel, cancellation, etc. They want health and safety protocols to be strictly followed. They are focusing on long-term planning and booking a in advance, with a few of them making reservations one year in advance. This shows that companies need to adapt quickly to this approach and facilitate it.” opines Anuja Bhosle, Senior Account Manager at Booking.comUsing distribution technology to formulate better pricingFritz feels that the key to hoteliers succeeding once travel is open is the flexibility to adapt to technology. It is better to have a partner who can empower you faster to the market. It is also essential to understand the right channels to connect to. This will enable pricing managers to form a solid strategy.\n\nAnuja prefers that the companies optimize their rate plan setup to strengthen their pricing strategy. By allowing maximum flexibility to the rate plans due to uncertain times, companies can adapt as required, letting more revenue flow.Helping partners tackle uncertainty in demand and driving recoveryAnuja further adds, “they have seen partners get the best results when they combine three specific rate plans:“Partners who have done so have realized a 5% increase in bookings according to booking.com’s data. Also, 44% who booked last year said that free cancellation is the sole reason they planned their travel so early.”On the other hand, Fritz maintains that they have seen that their partners have diversified their connection to multiple channels. “With RezGain’s Smart Distribution (SD) module, a channel manager by RateGain, it suggests the right channels to make better decisions faster. Businesses can have a speedy setup with the recommendations from it. We are supporting hotels by recommending new source markets. In this regard, we are working alongside booking.com’s APIs to give hoteliers a chance to capture the traveler’s imagination.”“Hotels are trying hard to get in front of the end customers. To achieve this, tools like social media and rich content would help in getting direct bookings. We are also supporting that with our social media services company, BCV.” he adds.RateGain has partnered with Booking.com to help deliver a better experience to their customers as well as internal teams. RateGain has implemented several features from the Booking.com extranet portal, which facilitates a seamless and bug-free user experience. These features include new properties to set up, rate-type, promotions, etc.Solving pent-up demand challenges once markets open for businessAnuja further beleives that maintaining competitiveness should be the utmost priority for hotels. Rethink the competition – and do not give away random discounts, which can badly hurt margins. Learning from relevant data at hand is essential; administer weeks of pricing patterns and test them out. There is a strong need to move beyond solely focusing on rates.“Try to find the right tools and set yourself up for the release of pent-up demand is important. For this, you need to utilize analytics to keep a close watch on the competition, see new source markets, optimize right channel mix, etc. This is where RezGain’s Smart Distribution can help. Working with the right channels and distribution partners is the key.” says Fritz from RateGain.“By utilizing forward-looking demand projections, you can anticipate and go accordingly. The market is going to be very dynamic post pandemic. For me, pent-up demand is like a balloon –release the pressure slowly by starting now. Getting the right messaging out to the travelers is equally important in the present recovery scenario.” he adds.Key TakeawaysBoth Anuja and Fritz believe that the market is still volatile and that things are still shaky at the moment. But, hopefully by the end of the year, if things go the way they are going at the moment, the industry should be well on its way to a strong recovery.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mark-haywood-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" /> Mark Haywood<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nGeneral Manager/ SVP – Europe, Africa, Brazil\n\nRateGainIn his current role, Mark manages the commercial team throughout Europe, North Africa, and Brazil and leads the overall strategy and growth across all three key business lines of distribution, business intelligence, & social media optimization in these regions.Prior to joining RateGain’s international leadership team, Mark had 22 years of relevant and varied industry experience within the hospitality sector.

65632800a3f6fc78b8eba1f0,1962548942,Why We Must Tell a Visual Data Story,"April 30, 2021","Most of us hate the way business data is shared with us, and we have brands like Netflix, Google, and Amazon to thank for that! These websites and apps have mastered the art of presentation for digital users with intuitive layouts, action buttons and content prompts and suggestions. Why cannot the same design principles be applied to enterprise data?We have always liked experience which is more contextual/ personal and does delight us. The same expectation is of a B2B customer as well. Though they have trained themselves on complicated spreadsheets, but they are also looking for a simple answer to their questions.Hence as UX and Design practitioners it is important that we design data and help people make informed decesionsBusinesses use data to understand their target users, discover new trends, and ensure they are on the right track. But in most cases, the data they need is shared in an unsexy, raw form like tabular rows or pivot tables and confusing pie charts. A lot of business-driven decisions are based on tons of data and let’s face it, no one has that much time to go through the data line by line. And more often than not business users will receive data not relevant to their role because the data has not been organized by personas. The issue is we often forget how hard it is to be a consumer of data.\n\n\n\nVisualizing and sharing data in a manner that combines large sets of complex data that help users understand and apply the information they have. Data designing is the art of communicating and interpreting raw data into meaningful insights that are easily consumable, harnessing data’s potential as a powerful tool for organizational changeTable of ContentsWhy is data designing relevant today?The world has become increasingly connected with smart devices, IoT sensors, and other technologies like AI gaining ground. The volume of data continues to burgeon, with IDC predicting a whopping 163 trillion gigabytes by 2025. The human brain cannot comprehend such large amounts of statistics without drawing some analogy or abstraction. Data visualization and designing can play an important part in creating those abstractions.UX designers must understand data visualization best practices and determine the best way to present a data set visually, maintaining its appeal and accuracy. Especially when handling very large data sets, developing a cohesive format is vital to creating visualizations that are both useful and visually appealing. Clear visualizations make complex data easier to grasp, and therefore easier to take action on.Cohesive data for Travel and Hospitality firmsRateGain has been helping the Travel and Hospitality industry understand and view complex data sets with ease. Our latest creation, Demand.ai, takes an innovative approach to solving the data conundrum for travel firms and hotels. It provides a data experience that is personalized, contextual, and relevant and allows users to apply data to daily activities and operations, as well as on-the-shop-floor concerns such as inventory management.We’ve structured our data visualization process into key stages:Understand the dataThere’s no shortcut to this first step. You need to understand how the data fits together and what needs to be presented and prioritized.\n\nInstead of showing the data, try can create contextual insights.Graph, Chart, or Something Else?Creating and maintaining a consistent visual approach that makes sense to the user while maintaining the integrity of the original data can be challenging. Visualizing data and presenting it in a user-friendly format must take into account measurements, date ranges, and time periods so you can develop a meaningful representation.Tune it to match the userWe invest a lot of effort through consultation and testing before we get a data report right. Every report should speak to its intended audience almost intuitively, and be free from unnecessary statistics and jargon. We also present data in a way that best connects with the target audience in terms of color and other visual elements. We also take special care to make data easy to consume on any kind of mobile device, because the user could get the itch to read anywhere!Align the design with each brandOnce the sorting of data is complete and we move into the creative aspect of presenting data, we make sure that the report matches the brand and domainTakeaway: Your data designing cheat sheetHere’s a quick peek into how we design our data to tell a story to help you get started:Who?Start with research, identify the users and their goals, and ask questions like:What?Then sort out the essential data that can be meaningful, extract the various data points such as:How?The next step is to understand how to display the data.To take advantage of all the data they have pouring in, many travel firms and hotels see the value of data visualizations in the efficient absorption of vital information, enabling decision-makers to understand complex industry shifts, identify new patterns in consumer behavior, and make data-driven decisions.

65632803a3f6fc78b8eba1f2,1510179132,Airlines Revenue Management Checklist for 2021,"April 29, 2021","Table of ContentsWhat RMs need to do to ensure successful inflowAt this point, most airlines would have been running to full capacities, raking in profits on almost all routes. However, Covid-19 had other plans for us. The pandemic which struck havoc in late 2019 has left most airlines reeling in debts.The start of 2021 has seen some recovery in terms of flight occupancy but it is a long, bumpy road. Ciaran Brannigan, Ex-director of Revenue, Ryanair gives us a lowdown of the situation and what can be done to accelerate recovery.Impact of Covid-19 on Revenue Management and PricingHistorical data rendered unusableFor starters, the pandemic has rendered all available historic data irrelevant to the Revenue Managers (RMs). They can now no longer rely on past seasonal trends to price upcoming trips. Additionally, the traditional pricing segmentation based on time to departure is not working towards stimulating demand, as the booking windows have now been condensed to a very short period, with a large number of flights being booked just days or hours before departure.Governmental restrictions and regulationsGovernments across the world are proactively updating the standard rules and operating protocols about travel in and out of their country, as well as within their country, based on the prevailing severity of Covid. Certain countries have regulations formed even at the micro-level, meaning travel to one part of the country is straightforward whereas another city might have additional restrictions. RMs need to be aware of this ever-changing set of protocols and will need to plan their actions accordingly.Data acquisition challenges“Revenue Managers are facing a massive challenge concerning data available for decision making. Traditional methods of data collection and analysis are no longer sufficient while preparing a plan of action. To aid quick recovery, RMs need to supplement existing data with a range of diversified data taken from previously unexplored sources, such as local OTAs, competitor data, etc., acquired several times a day as opposed to weekly, monthly, or half-yearly as was the case earlier.” opines Ciaran.In this regard, it is essential to leverage the knowledge of all teams within the organization, with the RMs and pricing teams working hand in hand to align with the overall commercial goals of the airline. Network planning teams, by reissuing schedules as frequently as weekly instead of the traditional biannual release can with the help of RM teams identify which routes are profitable and enjoying higher occupancy, thereby allowing more aircraft to fly on those routes while reducing flights on non-performing routes.Long term evolution of RM and pricingAs observed from pandemics in the past centuries, although the recovery trajectory is slow, it is inevitable. In our current situation too, signs of recovery are evident as the year progresses. However, the shape of recovery is likely to be extremely volatile and bumpy, requiring RM teams to be flexible in their decisions and action plans.Localized outbreaks and governmental curbs could set back the recovery process in certain markets. By being dynamic and constantly updated with such information, the RM teams can quickly address such potential concerns, devising an alternative plan of action.RMs need to revisit the information that is available to them in their Revenue Management System, as this data could pertain to internal and historic statistics that may not be relevant in the current scenario.Moving forward, teams will need to discard the siloed approach to data and work in tandem for data collection and analysis. Data which earlier was periodically obtained and which is currently obtained intra-day is likely to see a shift to live sourcing in the future, where every new booking or emerging trend is recorded and quantified instantaneously on the Revenue Management System, allowing for quick, dynamic, impromptu decisions. As the booking windows get shorter, the data must be fresh as possible.Due to the lack of stable booking trends and patterns, competitive data is really important. This will need to be supplemented with external as well as internal data to help understand customer behavior in terms of decision-making, breakpoints or hurdles.Avoiding over-congestionAll airlines are now shifting capacity to where they feel recovery will start first. Most airlines see capacity moving towards beaches and similar leisure destinations where Covid fears are lesser. If every airline adds flights to that destination, it could lead to an oversupply situation, resulting in lower occupancy for everyone – Every RM’s nightmare!To address this, RMs can use competitor data combined with information obtained by partnering with OTAs and Metasearch engines that can give detailed insights on customer booking patterns.Making the most out of regulatory environment data“The biggest changes in demand have been noticed when governments have changed regulations, be it either around ease of access or shutdown of certain markets. Being up-to-date on these trends is key as it can determine the success or failure of a route,” says Ciaran.In this regard, opening up dialogues with local people or organizations that can give you a lowdown of the prevailing circumstances in their respective countries can help in determining profitable routes.All in all, 2021 is a make-or-break year for the airline industry, and Revenue Management teams have a major role to play in how things shape out for their respective airlines.About the Author Ciaran Brannigan \n\nEx- Director of Revenue\n\nRyanairCiaran Brannigan is an experienced commercial leader, have been part of one of the most successful airlines in Europe with a background in the airlines and retail sectors.

65632805a3f6fc78b8eba1f4,2098409071,"Cap on Wedding Guests Might Pinch, But It's a Necessary Evil","December 25, 2020","From limiations to event capacity, there are several challenges that have suddenly arisen with the surge of Covid cases in the capital, but the industry is finding its way out to deal with the situation. Two weeks ago, Aviral had booked 25 rooms at a Delhi hotel for his family members to stay for a December 5th wedding. Flight tickets have been booked, cards have been distributed and payments are done in advance for a 200-people wedding. Suddenly, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the permission to allow 200 people at weddings has been withdrawn to only 50 people. Aviral is clueless and so is the wedding industry in Delhi.As the Capital enters peak wedding season, an industry that is already in trouble says it fears this could completely break its back. “Wedding bookings are being cancelled due to the limit reduction of guests. Some clients want to postpone the events to a later date when they can invite at least 200 guests to attend the celebrations,” said Bhavnesh Sawhney, Co-founder, FB Celebrations Pvt. Ltd, an events and weddings planning company.With the limitations on venue and event capacity, there are several challenges that have suddenly arisen. Most people are either cancelling and postponing their weddings or going ahead with it at a much smaller scale. They are expecting advances back or agreed amounts to be drastically reduced.“Some preparations and elements have already been arranged and paid for during the planning stage but are no longer needed to be used. Similarly, a lot of other associated vendors’ and artists’ dates are being released. Disinviting previously invited guests is an awkward conversation to have, but given the scenario, it is quite understandable,” Sawhney said.For hotels in the capital, which were in the process of recovery and were pinning hopes on the wedding season for green shoots, the reduced number capping may lead them to do the brainstorming again.“We may look at a delayed revival process rather than an effect on the revival process,” commented Kamesh Shukla, EVP and Head for APMEA-RateGain. He informed that India is at the moment at 82% of bookings compared to last year, and that is owed to multiple factors one of which is the upcoming wedding season.According to Shukla, there is a chance that a certain segment of people will delay their weddings to Q1 calendar year 2021 for which hotels have already started offering special rates and book places in advance.<img width=""700"" height=""366"" decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cap-on-wedding-guests-might-pinch-but-its-a-necessary-evil-1.jpg"" alt="""" />“Even before this cap was introduced hotels had come up with options of bundled pricing for a limited gathering wedding to ensure decent yield by offering all services under one roof to the family, to provide a hassle-free experience and ensure only reliable, COVID-safe providers are part of the wedding,” he added.Respecting the government’s decision with the rising number of covid cases, ibis New Delhi Aerocity is coming up with various new ways to ensure small events taking place adhering to strict precautions.“In the last few months, many travel trends like staycations and workations have gained popularity which will continue. It’s important hotels continue to re-think and re-imagine alternate revenue streams to meet the demands of the changing times,” Anant Leekha, Deputy General Manager, ibis New Delhi Aerocity said.Leekha mentioned that since the size of the celebrations have substantially reduced, especially after the recent announcement, there is a growing demand for customized and personalized solutions in terms of F&B offerings, decor, accommodation etc. “We have a number of wedding and social events lined up for the next few months,” he saidWith the permission of limited guest number, Amaara Farms in Delhi is advising its clients to invite guests in batches or slipt them in two functions. Shivan Gupta, the Founder of Amaara Farms feels that till the rising number of new cases doesn’t stabilize, a small, intimate affair is the key.Amaara Farms have started with strict measures when it comes to number of guests and list management in October itself. This covered not just guests but the vendors as well. “We are even making our clients sign an understanding of our dos and donts to help us comply with all the necessary measures. Additionally, the limited human touch and sanitization are the mandatory practices. With the current change, the only alteration is the number of guests and all our services remain the same,” Gupta mentioned.These unprecedented times have pushed the professionals across segments to innovate and simplify. Same goes for the wedding and hospitality industry to stay relevant in the current times. “There’s been a downward trend and we aren’t recording to see a recovery till the first half of 2021,” Gupta added.While the new regulations and updates will continue to pinch the industry, the industry understands that it will be a bitter medicine towards healing.About the Author Sakshi Singh Source:hospitality.economictimes.indiatimes.com",https://rategain.com/blog/cap-on-wedding-guests-might-pinch-but-its-a-necessary-evil/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cap-on-wedding-guests-might-pinch-but-its-a-necessary-evil-3.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cap-on-wedding-guests-might-pinch-but-its-a-necessary-evil-3.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cap-on-wedding-guests-might-pinch-but-its-a-necessary-evil-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Hotel,,,,,,,0
65632806a3f6fc78b8eba1f6,1018507518,"We have been Profitable Since Inception: Yogeesh Chandra- Global Head of Corporate Development, RateGain","December 22, 2020","In an interview with BW Disrupt, Yogeesh Chandra- Global Head of Corporate Development, RateGain, talks about funding and monetization status, competitors, responses post lockdown and more. Table of Contents1. How did the idea come to start the business?The idea of RateGain came after our Founder Bhanu Chopra embarked on his consulting career, where he would travel over the weekends with a limited budget and would look for the best deal online to do the maximum number of trips. As he returned to India, he wanted to start a consumer-facing portal to provide price comparison; however he soon realized that it was not practical to run this from India and pivoted to capture the opportunity of providing intelligence to travel companies, specifically OTAs on how their competition is pricing their products. From there on, Bhanu scaled the business and identified an opportunity to provide intel to hotels as well as car rentals to see prices on OTAs as well as distribute their inventory on it to allow users to book the best price.2. What are the unique key points of your company?We have been profitable since inception; and work with 23 out of 30 leading hotel chains; 25 of top 30 OTAs; all top car rentals; the five largest cruise lines; all the top travel management companies and the fastest growing airlines.3. How are you different from the existing competitors?RateGain is the only provider of end-to-end revenue maximization solutions that allow travel and hospitality companies to get the right intelligence, in real-time; and distribute it across 1500+ channels; as well as help in providing a seamless guest experience to over 13000 customers in 191 countries.4. What is the funding status and monetization model?RateGain is a profitable company since its very first year of inception. We are financially disciplined and will end up profitable even in the current year despite travel industry facing its biggest crisis. We raised our series A in 2015 with a minority investment from TA Associates.We have also recently had some growth capital infusion, which is a testament the opportunity ahead of us as a company. Since we have a very strong playbook on the M&A side, we would be raising our series B in the next few months to consolidate the fragmented travel tech landscape.Our monetization model is a mix of license fee based subscription model paid in advance and transaction fee for the $13 B worth of bookings we process for the hospitality industry.5. What challenges are you facing in running your business?The current challenges include the mixed sentiment around recovery of travel in the short term. We see travel as a necessary human activity in today’s time where people long for experiences overspending on physical goods. The mid term to long term travel related outlook stays intact and its percentage as a GDP overall is only likely to increase. Thus the current times need to be looked at objectively where organizations that are profitable, scaled up, with a varied product portfolio and a proven management such as ours stand apart from the travel tech landscape at large. If any indication on the post lockdown travel intent is a yardstick, travel industry’s challenge is short lived.6. How has been your partner’s/ customer’s response so far post lockdown?The pandemic has been incredibly hard for the travel and hospitality industry. As a partner that believes in maximizing revenue, our customer success teams have doubled down to ensure our partners and customers get the required data and support to drive revenue.From a recovery standpoint, our business is seeing a steady recovery on our distribution and marketing side, with hotels focusing in driving future bookings as well as building digital strategies to attract the guest and drive revenue.We are now seeing a recovery of close to 45% when compared to the same period last year with recovery being driven majorly by United States, Mexico, Germany, India and UAE.With restrictions easing off in the United States and the festive season coming up in other parts of the world, we are expecting recovery to go upto 60% for most countries except parts of Europe which are now experiencing a second wave7. What are the traction details (achievements of the company)?Before the pandemic, RateGain had scaled revenues by 8x in the last 5 years, completed two acquisitions in the US and had tripled profits as well. Apart from this the company had been recognized 4-times by Deloitte as one of the fastest-growing technology companies in India, as well as recognized by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce as the startup of the year.8. How do you look at expansion?RateGain is building the travel industry cloud and is unique as it covers all facets of travel like Hotels, Travel Agencies, Car Rentals, Vacation Rentals, Airlines, and Cruise Lines. Even in current times, all facets of travel have not been equally impacted and some have recovered rapidly to close to pre-COVID levels. With a wide portfolio, we have a three-fold view on expansion.Organic Expansion: Certain product categories, industry categories are positioned for high organic growth based on multiple factors like industry tailwinds, the maturity of the product, TAM, and product differentiation.Mergers and Acquisitions: Apart from organic growth, we have a strong M&A playbook with a dedicated team covering all aspects of corporate development. The travel technology landscape has a lot of fragmentation in the lower end of the ARR spectrum and in a lot of cases those subscale, single pollution companies need global footprint and scale related expertise that RateGain offers. We are open to tuck-in, product extension and aqui-hire opportunities across specific geographies like North America, Europe and Asia. Currently we have over 40 companies on our target list and are actively engaging with 11 companies around it.Innovation: Since the industry and the consumer behaviour is witnessing a change, this is the right time to get ahead and innovate with new product capabilities that will help us in acquiring, retaining and expanding the wallet share of end travellers for our clients.We have invested in RG Labs (An intra organization incubator with a dedicated budget)and already identified two critical areas where we would want to lead with innovation. These areas can be larger than even our current products over the next few years and we are very excited about leading innovation here.About the Author Yogeesh Chandra \n\nGlobal Head of Corporate Development\n\nRateGainSource:bwdisrupt.businessworld.in",https://rategain.com/blog/we-have-been-profitable-since-inception-yogeesh-chandra-global-head-of-corporate-development-rategain/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/We-have-been-profitable-since-inception-3.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/We-have-been-profitable-since-inception-3.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Business,Revenue Management,,,,,,0
65632808a3f6fc78b8eba1f8,156278312,Some Employees are Getting a New Job…At Their Old Job,"December 21, 2020","Kushal Kolthe, a senior revenue manager at holiday home rental company Vista Rooms, was put on leave without pay in late March. “Initially some of us were asked to take a sabbatical but as the Covid situation worsened, we were told to go on LWP. They were very upfront and transparent about it,” says the Mumbai resident. “Of course I wasn’t really happy about it but I understood it’s a difficult decision.” In the intervening months, Kolthe tried to start a brand with his friends which kept him occupied for a while. Then, in August he got a new job… his old one.Rehiring has become a bit of a trend of late, says Munira Loliwala, Business Head, Permanent and Specialised staffing, Team-Lease, a staffing company. “Across industries, 40% of our client base is considering or looking at rehiring laid off workers. This is happening the most in the financial services industry, then in manufacturing, followed by hospitality and healthcare,” she says. For the most part, however, these are not permanent positions. “The rehiring is usually for some project work, or as freelancers to add certain skills or improve sales productivity. Of the 40% looking to rehire, only 5-10% would be as permanent positions,” adds Loliwala.Amit Damani, founder of Vista Rooms, says they had to put half their 200-people workforce on leave when the hospitality industry was badly hit by the pandemic. “We had hired a lot of people from January onwards because we were looking to expand quite aggressively, but when this happened, we had to, as all businesses did, reconfigure our plans,” he says. So 100-odd people were sent on leave and told that they were the company’s first priority when the situation improved.In July, as the interest in private homes and villas grew, they began to make good on their promise. They have brought about 50 people back. “Ninety per cent of the people were let go not because of performance but circumstances. This was a way of showing we value their experience,” says Damani. He also pointed out one big advantage of rehiring — those employees have already been part of the system and familiar with processes and culture.Loliwala says the definition of rehiring is different in these cases. “The typical example of it was someone who voluntarily resigns and rejoins two years later at a different level. Here, we’re talking about laid off workers.”Sahil Sharma, global head of Human Resources at travel and hotel software company RateGain, says they had to put 250 people across the globe on furlough. “Of the 130 people in India put on furlough, only 40 are still on it,” he says. “The rest have either come back or moved on to other opportunities. We kept our communication transparent about why we’re putting them on furlough, how soon they can come back, will they come back, all of that.” Their workers have returned on the same salaries, and any bonuses or promotions due were followed through on.As the HR head, though, Sharma had to have many conversations with employees who were let go. “March and April went into questions like ‘Why me? Why not her?’. But I explained that we didn’t look at performance but the role they have. The sales team, for instance, was reduced because no one was buying our product. But we needed our engineering team to address concerns of our existing clients.”Nisha Rawat, who works in client servicing at RateGain and was recently brought back, says despite the uncertainty, the furlough did give her some free time. “I appreciated their gesture to keep my medical cover throughout the furlough period.”About the Author Ketaki Desaih \n\nTime of IndiaSource:timesofindia.indiatimes.com",https://rategain.com/blog/some-employees-are-getting-a-new-jobat-their-old-job/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-employees-are-getting-a-new-job-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-employees-are-getting-a-new-job-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Business,,,,,,,0
65632809a3f6fc78b8eba1fa,-1270230173,Visioning The Post-COVID Era In Revenue Management,"December 21, 2020","Visioning a Post-COVID Era in Revenue Management — Special Series\n\nThis article was published as part of the Visioning a post-COVID Era Special Series\n\nVisit this viewpoint in the Hospitality Net’s World Panel.I have heard about the need for Revenue Management in the industry circles during this pandemic. The logic is if we are running 20% occupancy, then do we even need a Revenue Manager? This old school approach forgets the critical commercial role that today’s Revenue Managers play. Maximizing visibility across channels, ensuring competitive pricing across rooms and packages, tracking parity across channels/affiliates, monitoring rate changes for competitive set across different booking horizons including intra-day, evaluating meta channels and related ROI, pushing the sales teams to the right segments is a lot of work which only a skilled Revenue Manager can manage – all while taking out the local OTA Market Managers for lunch! The role of Revenue Managers in creating demand and impacting the top of funnel marketing is often misunderstood.This crisis has been unlike any other, and here is how Revenue Management might evolve in the Post-COVID world:In general, Revenue Management post-COIVD needs to play a larger role in the broader commercial strategy including asset management. The current scenario has added significant cost pressures and a good Revenue Manager will be able to step up and play a strategic role in these areas as they are analytical, objective and have the right experience and skill set in retail demand management, e-commerce, capacity utilization, segmentation yield/profitability, and general market trends.About the Author Chinmai Sharma \n\nPresident – Americas\n\nRateGainSource:hospitalitynet.org",https://rategain.com/blog/visioning-the-post-covid-era-in-revenue-management/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hospitality-Banner-no-cta.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hospitality-Banner-no-cta.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Business,Hospitality,Revenue Management,,,,,0
6563280ba3f6fc78b8eba1fc,554794794,50% Rise in Bookings Not Enough for India to Catch Up With Global Recovery,"December 21, 2020","Improved Recovery in Mumbai and Delhi likely to help hotels open in SeptemberIn the last update, we shared, we were hopeful of seeing a steady recovery in bookings and were certain that the government would allow hotels in the Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Bengaluru to operate. However the increase in cases in Bengaluru and the number of daily cases hovering around the 1000 mark in Delhi and Mumbai have made it difficult for the hospitality industry to make a strong case to both the government and the guests at large to come back in large numbers. According to STR,B-M-NCR as they are famously called has 34% share of the total inventory present in India, making it critical for them to start welcoming guests again to drive India’s recovery forward.As of 9th August, India’s recovery vis a vis last year has now touched 20%, which unfortunately is one of the lowest when compared to the sixteen largest tourism economies of the world. The heartening news is that it has moved from being at the absolute bottom on 2nd August to number 14. Only Italy and Australia are slower in their recovery according to bookings analysed by RateGain’s distribution platform which connects to over 250,000 hotels worldwide.A comparison of recovery trends over a 10 week period, starting at the end of May and ending at the beginning of August show that while America has sustained recovery at around 70%, other countries are moving towards the average recovery of 40% however South Asia continues to lag due to lack of demand from international markets with the exception of Thailand and UAE which are seeing a healthy recovery of 36% and 54% respectively.Focussing closer home we witness that India’s recovery continues with a 50% increase in bookings in the last two weeks crossing the 3000 mark for the first time since mid-March.When looking at cities, 25% of the bookings currently are for Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR markets however we are also seeing a growing trend of recovery in destinations like Jaipur, Chandigarh, Chail, Ranikhet, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer more remote destinations where guests are headed for either stayactions or marriage events.The heartening news is that with the slow yet sustained recovery of Tier-2 and remote destinations, the number of cancellations continue to remain low and stable with only 302 cancellations received last week.India is now testing 7 lakh samples every day and has the highest rate of daily new cases for the last couple of weeks. While some might see this situation as worrying, we are certain this only means that we would be able to control the virus faster as recovery rate crosses 70%. The vaccine in Russia might have faced severe criticism however it gives hope of the much needed human intervention that everyone has been asking for since the last eight months. Let’s continue to hope for a better tomorrow.About the AuthorFritz Müller \n\nVice President\n\nRateGainSource:newdealeuropeblog.medium.com",https://rategain.com/blog/50-rise-in-bookings-not-enough-for-india-to-catch-up-with-global-recovery/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-Deal-Europe-Weekly-Update-on-Tourism-to-the-Balkan-Region-Week-24-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-Deal-Europe-Weekly-Update-on-Tourism-to-the-Balkan-Region-Week-24-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Hospitality,Travel Technology,,,,,,0
6563280ca3f6fc78b8eba1fe,-1166088517,Tech Skills That can Rebuild the Travel Industry,"December 20, 2020","While hotels, vacation rentals, airlines and car rentals bring back the workforce to engage with guests in the new normal and deliver the perfect experience, the focus of travel and hospitality would shift to a new enabler- technology.The Covid-19 situation will be seen in history as a pivotal moment for tech-evolution. Every industry, process, interaction is now moving to be digitally first especially in high-touch sectors such as travel and hospitality. Most of these changes are permanent, affecting how people would travel, stay, relax, eat, buy souvenirs, etc. There would be micro-markets that would spring up as new local destinations gain traction, newer and smaller businesses offering new services, enhanced packages, staycation trips, and so on. Social media would also be a major driver with influencers making viral posts about their travel. While hotels, vacation rentals, airlines and car rentals bring back the workforce to engage with guests in the new normal and deliver the perfect experience, the focus of travel and hospitality would shift to a new enabler- technology.Technology to help travellers plan better, businesses serve faster, avoid long queues, enabling paperless and touchless ecosystems, smart stays, safe local travel, and so forth.Building these solutions would drive a huge demand for tech-talent to create contactless solutions for delivering a flawless experience, as well as build next-generation AI capabilities to predict demand volatility for the industry to be better prepared. For these reasons and more, I believe that travel would need and continue to attract the best tech-talent with the below skills:1. User Experience Specialists / Design Thinkers: User experience and more importantly design thinking is the need of the day given the plethora of systems in a hotel tech environment. Design thinking of building within system limits and UX’s concept of focus on the customer will bring out the next generation of travel applications that are a joy to use.2. API Programmers: Travellers would increasingly look for a seamless and connected cross-platform experience while booking. Businesses would also want to broaden their services with more partner integrations, social media presence, channel integrations, payment processing, biometric validations, etc. These would require remote APIs and orchestrations and building loosely-coupled, scalable, and interoperable systems.Programmers would have a tough job to build an intuitive and creative application or a site that seamlessly coordinates with multiple stakeholders simultaneously. It should be able to render the best deals and offers from consolidators scattered worldwide in real-time to customers, reduce time to market, render multilingual and multi-currency support, safe and secure payments, etc, all via an easy-to-use channel-agnostic interface.3. Platform Specialists: Actionable Distribution System (DS) and hospitality Business Intelligence (BI) are pivotal for companies to become smarter and efficient. They will have to understand the change in customer behaviour and respond accordingly to help deliver end-to-end services through the platform. It includes identifying and correcting the issues if any. For instance, a Platform Specialist for a booking platform should have a thorough understanding of the group booking capabilities or limitations of the platform and should propose solutions to rectify the same. An agile mindset, proactive attitude, and in-depth knowledge of company offerings will be the key skills needed.4. Data Scientists: Travel systems generate a ton of data. Whether it’s data from bookings or data from advertising and conversion, model building becomes easier similar to the financial services industry. Some of the examples are using booking data to affect advertising campaigns and micro targeting or booking data to affect distribution channel mix.5. Cloud Services: Cloud computing offers travel agencies the speed and responsiveness they need to cater to a rapidly changing market. Besides, data storage and application development become a breeze with cloud services. In fact, most companies are following a multi-cloud strategy nowadays as SaaS platforms become indispensable for the foreseeable future.6. Enterprise Architects and Data Architects: The job of an Enterprise Architect involves overseeing, improving, and upgrading the hardware and software timely for a smooth customer experience. We are living in an era, where customer patience is short-lived and customer experience is supreme. Here, a downtime in digital services and networks or a technical glitch can jeopardize both revenue and reputation, as the customer might hop on to other travel sites and apps in the meanwhile. In short, this technical specialist must possess the best skills (technical or soft skills) to extend a perfect digital product replete with uninterrupted services. Similar to EAs, DAs are key to data governance and data stitching due to the plethora of systems that co-exist in any hospitality or travel company.7. Mobile First: Many of the new apps we build are built mobile first especially in these Covid times where employees are doing more with fewer resources and longer durations. This requires communications (alerts, messaging, actions) to be brought to the employee rather than the employee going to a singular desktop/laptop.However, we might see fewer roles for ‘Administrator’ (such as DB Administrator, Network Administrator, Web Server Administrator, etc) within the organisation. This is because the increasing popularity of managed cloud services will need lesser set-ups, taking over administrative tasks. Besides, DevOps has brought in automation wherein developers themselves are taking care of deployments. Undoubtedly, these Administrators need super-specializations and require decades of hands-on experience to fine-tune and operate large enterprises. This advice is less for such super-specialists but more for new joiners and aspirants.Apart from these, there will be an emerging need for industry mentors or coaches, which might be a contract-based role. These mentors could be practising people having professional and personal skills on how to decode complex problems and can help take big-small decisions, perform reviews, guide or make suggestions, and so forth.Apart from this, small tools and techniques can go a long way to streamline operations in a jiffy. For instance, whiteboards are the fastest and most-economical tools of written communication for a group, while group discussions are super productive to bring a large group of people on the same page immediately. What we might need are more mentors and coaches to lead and facilitate these discussions. People with broader technology understanding who know pros & cons, possess end-to-end ownership mindset, calculated risk-taking, PPT, and whiteboard writing and good communication skills can take the travel industry to newer heights. Moreover, critical thinkers are irreplaceable in all industries, irrespective of their technical skillset.About the Author Deepak Kapoor \n\nEVP – Engineering\n\nRateGainSource:hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com",https://rategain.com/blog/tech-skills-that-can-rebuild-the-travel-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tech-skills-that-can-rebuild-the-travel-industry-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tech-skills-that-can-rebuild-the-travel-industry-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Business,Product Design,User experience,,,,,0
6563280da3f6fc78b8eba200,1571905016,After China can 'Revenge Travel' Happen in India?,"December 18, 2020","The Indian hospitality industry is desperate for the revenge travel phenomenon to enter India. The sinister sounding term “Revenge Travel” gained momentum after people in China started travelling within the country to satiate their wanderlusting instincts amid the coronavirus travel bans.The Indian hospitality industry has been desperately awaiting for this phenomenon to happen in India and it remains to be seen, if or when it happens here.Here’s what experts have to say:This pandemic has seriously crippled the Indian hospitality industry. Due to the spread of the virus, travel plans of Indians have come to a halt. But a slow recovery is on the cards for the travel and tourism industry.According to a Mckinsey report, “The end of lockdown would mean the first thing people would want to do is eat out, and the second thing is travel.”US-based HVS Global Hospitality Services and Indian real estate research firm ANAROCK said in a report, “While corporate travel and travel for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions will reduce, domestic travel could take off soon. ‘Revenge travel’ witnessed in China could foster among Indians too.”RateGain in its Global Report on the Impact of COVID-19 on Hospitality said, “In a survey of 15 countries and over 2.5 lakh hotels, India is the worst hit country in hotel recovery. But the future looks promising as India ranks third in the list of future bookings during November to December.”However, it seems like the tourism and hospitality industry would take years before it can get back to pre-COVID levels.At a Tourism Conclave hosted by Hindustan Times, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, “I’ve been associated with tourism for a long time. Globally, World Tourism Organisation tracked 217 destinations, out of which 72 percent had closed borders to international tourists during the pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted the tourism industry, which is a big job creator.“We must follow proper precautions, promote domestic tourism and become an adventure tourist. We need to discover hills and mountains and seek fresh air. This time is an opportunity to make India the safest place for travellers, particularly women. It is time to build good protocols and guidelines, sensitise the local community, create world-class infrastructure and make the community a part of tourism’s growth process.”With the festive season coming up and holidays ahead, there could be some green shoots for the travel and tourism industry, but keeping safety protocols intact and creating trust among travellers would be an uphill task.About the Author Shivangi Pandey Source:cnbctv18.com",https://rategain.com/blog/after-china-can-revenge-travel-happen-in-india/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/After-China-can-Revenge-Travel-happen-in-India-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/After-China-can-Revenge-Travel-happen-in-India-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,COVID19,Hospitality,,,,,,0
6563280fa3f6fc78b8eba202,-810522576,Travel & Hospitality Sector Will Take 12-15 Months To Cross Pre-covid Level Hiring Figures: Industry Leaders,"December 16, 2020","As per a recent report released by Indeed, job searches for roles in the hospitality and tourism sector have been on the rise since May, coinciding with the easing of lockdown measures across the country. Searches by job seekers saw a 30 per cent increase between May and August 2020. In these times of turmoil giving way to transformation, HR leaders have developed creative means like hackathons and other brainstorming sessions to stimulate creativity, innovations, and rapid execution of fresh business models.The Covid-19 outbreak has presented unprecedented circumstances before the travel and hospitality industry. The sector is challenged at both fronts of generating new revenue as well as reducing operational costs to survive, making it difficult to not only invest in new technologies but also retain the best employees.Table of ContentsTravel industry will witness a shift towards tech-driven jobs While the lack of employees’ trust in this industry’s capability is the key short-term challenge, Sahil Sharma, Global Head – Human Resources at RateGain, believes some of the biggest long-term hurdles are to innovatively act on the talent acquisition strategies, creating a sustainable EVP (employee value proposition) and employer brand, and studying the talent market’s behaviours, perceptions and expectations.Sharma said, “As businesses reopen and the need for technology increases to provide the perfect guest experience, the industry will need to build new teams that can enable and integrate new-tech initiatives with existing processes to deliver a safe and delightful experience, making the sector a favourite amongst the tech workforce.”Like many other industries, the pandemic has accelerated digitization and will benefit online travel and hospitality businesses. Therefore, Prasad Menon, Chief People Officer, Cleartrip, opined that the travel industry will witness a shift towards jobs dominated by workers carrying knowledge in areas such as technology, product, design, analytics, digital marketing, and customer service.“The shift towards remote working also implies that companies will place a premium on cross-border talent who can work with and manage teams across multiple international locations,” Menon said.It will take around 12-15 months to cross pre-Covid level hiring figuresAs per a recent report released by Indeed, job searches for roles in the hospitality and tourism sector have been on the rise since May, coinciding with the easing of lockdown measures across the country. Searches by job seekers saw a 30 per cent increase between May and August 2020.Speaking on the same, Sharma said traveling and exploring are instincts for humans, and you cannot curb them for long.“In India, we are now seeing the trend of revenge travel, with bookings now reaching 65 per cent of the Pre-Covid levels. Therefore, the leadership at RateGain looks at the next year optimistically and hopes that very soon international and corporate travel would resume, helping the industry move towards a better tomorrow,” he said.From a hiring perspective, RateGain is bullish on the trends, Sharma observed and believed it will take about 12-15 months to cross the pre-Covid-level hiring figures.Similarly, Menon deduced that travel has been recovering from the lows of March and April.“The pandemic has only delayed travel consumption and has not extinguished it. Our market intelligence indicates a substantial amount of pent-up demand, which will gradually come back over time,” he said.According to Menon, the current market volumes are around 40 per cent of the pre-Covid levels, and it will probably take a few quarters for the sector to go back to the pre-Covid levels ultimately.However, Menon said, “hiring may not necessarily move in sync as many industry participants have worked hard to improve processes and build efficiencies.” The industry will see an increasing focus on value over volumes and the hiring focus, therefore, will pivot towards quality and specialized skills and not necessarily on numbers, he added.HR leaders became the torchbearers\n\nSince the pandemic has changed customer needs and laid focus on the industry’s stress points, industry leaders said customers are now placing an equal emphasis on safety and flexibility in travel plans. And for many customers, these two needs have taken precedence over price.In these times of turmoil giving way to transformation, HR leaders have developed creative means like hackathons and other brainstorming sessions to stimulate creativity, innovations, and rapid execution of fresh business models.From an HR process perspective, Cleartrip has had to reimagine and re-contextualizing its entire talent management process to help the company offer a differentiated value proposition.Menon said, “The pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote working. HR, therefore, has had to work hard in enabling managers with skill sets to help function and marshal their teams in this changing virtual environment.”As remote working also poses a challenge in sustaining informal conversations that go a long way in maintaining and enriching company culture, Cleartrip has therefore instituted numerous initiatives such as online yoga sessions, Zumba sessions, leadership sessions, mentorship sessions, photography contests, to name a few.Additionally, Menon said, HR leaders even reach out to employees regularly to have a sense of the organisation’s pulse and have also significantly contributed to efficiency improvement measures.With the unlocking, RateGain is also gradually opening its offices with the limited staff, with all the required precautions.“We were amongst the first ones to announce the WFH across all our global offices – Our employees’ safety was of utmost importance. As the festive season draws closer and the industry sees some recovery, RateGain is helping employees take a well-deserved time off by providing an entire week-off in addition to the paid leaves they have to help them rejuvenate and spend time with their loved ones,” Sharma said.Calling HR as more than just a function, Sharma said they have the right tools and capabilities to support the organisation in bringing the strategy to execution.“In times like these, HR leaders must play a pivotal role by not only ensuring alignment around the organisation’s vision and values but keep the culture of the organisation on top of mind, as an enabler of any strategy,” he added.About the Author Abhishek Sahu Source:hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com",https://rategain.com/blog/travel-hospitality-sector-will-take-12-15-months-to-cross-pre-covid-level-hiring-figures-industry-leaders/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Travel-hospitality-sector-will-take-12-15-months-to-cross-pre-Covid-level-hiring-figures-Industry-leaders-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Travel-hospitality-sector-will-take-12-15-months-to-cross-pre-Covid-level-hiring-figures-Industry-leaders-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,COVID19,Hospitality,,,,,,0
65632811a3f6fc78b8eba204,742377673,What Hotels Need to Know About the Staycation Boom,"December 16, 2020","Although the fallout from COVID-19 has hit domestic travel hard, with the US Travel Association estimating $402 billion in cumulative losses since March, there is a silver lining in an increase in consumers wanting to travel locally. RateGain has found a 4x increase in staycations, in which consumers travel by car to a hotel located an average of two to four hours away, and expect this trend to continue into 2021. Hotels have a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on this trend for the 2020 holiday season and into 2021, and it will take some social media savvy as well as a laser focus on the local market to see results.Table of ContentsThe Rise in StaycationsFrom our work with the major hotels in the U.S., RateGain a hospitality software company has seen a significant increase in staycation bookings – 4x the rate from September 2019 to September 2020 – and expect those numbers to rise as COVID continues to restrict travel. Consumers are interested in staycations as they offer a break in routine without the risks associated with long-distance travel. Factor in the trends of more people working from home and a large number of children in distance-learning, and you have a very enticing environment for people to take local trips. In addition, consumers are tending toward different hotel habits when booking staycations, with price no longer one of the main considerations. Consumers are typically booking closer to their departure date, valuing their desired dates of stay over price considerations or special deals. In addition, the staycation’s length of stay is typically longer than typical hotel stays, given the flexibility provided by work from home and distance learning.How to Attract the StaycationerHotels should first go local for guests. Logical targets are past guests local to the hotel, first moving through direct contact, such as email. From there, they can expand to targeting local guests who might be interested in a staycation, outlining different interests or incentives. Highlighting kid-friendly attractions near the hotel for families, for example, or showcasing outdoor activities for the active traveler are good ways to start. Hotels can also reference changes in traditional holiday plans, in which many families are having smaller, local gatherings. Offering to be the new holiday location or the respite after the holidays is a good way to attract local guests. Finally, hotels should plan for staycationers to stay longer but also conduct work or learning functions during their stay. Make sure to highlight all network capabilities as well as any alternative work locations (such as spacious lobbies) that are available.The Social Media DifferentiatorRateGain noticed something interesting this past summer: as the chatter concerning COVID lessened, booking activity for local hotel stays started to increase. Hotels should look to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to publicize local deals. The strategy should include content creation to entice locals to relax during the “new normal,” and provide examples of how the hotel can enhance their experience, such as “hiking breaks between Zoom calls.” Hotels should look to video to capture the detail of the hotel as well as local attractions, providing sample day itineraries, for example.Bundling the DealsRateGain has also noticed an increase in car rentals for local travel, with families wanting either roomier transportation or not wanting to put miles on their personal vehicles. Hotels can work with area car rental agencies to provide special rates for travelers going to the hotel. Similarly, hotels can bundle tickets to local attractions or special rates at COVID-safe restaurants for local guests. Thinking creatively with local businesses can be a win-win for both hotels as well as the consumer.Let’s GoRateGain believes that staycations could increase after the election, with many people wanting a break from politics or the never-ending intense news cycles. Starting immediately with plans for post-election, Thanksgiving, Christmas / Winter Break / New Year’s campaigns will give hotels a good advantage.About the Author Mark Skroch \n\nGeneral Manager\n\nBCV – A RateGain CompanySource:hospitalitytech.com",https://rategain.com/blog/what-hotels-need-to-know-about-the-staycation-boom/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/What-Hotels-Need-to-Know-About-the-Staycation-Boom-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/What-Hotels-Need-to-Know-About-the-Staycation-Boom-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,BCV,COVID19,Hospitality,,,,,0
65632813a3f6fc78b8eba206,-1736722434,Here’s How Hoteliers Can Attract New Travelers in the Post-COVID Era,"December 16, 2020","COVID-19 has had deep and far-reaching impact on the tourism industry. And, while the world waits for a universally-safe vaccine, most businesses – especially hotels – are starting to plan for the future. How will consumer tastes change as a result of the pandemic?The “new guest” of the immediate post-COVID era will have different needs and expectations of their hotel stay. Property managers can start building services and amenities that meet the demands of the first influx of travelers to arrive after the lifting of COVID travel restrictions now – because only by investing in the right tools and technology today can you get an edge on your competition then. Here’s how traveler expectations have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and what your hotel needs to do to win more bookings in the future.Table of ContentsWho is the Traveler of the Future?Travelers are paying close attention to how all brands – and especially hotels – are communicating and reacting to the pandemic. Brands that are perceived as “insensitive” to keeping guests safe, or seen as not taking precautions seriously, will be punished in the post-COVID era.There are a few data points from RateGain that demonstrate this point. First and foremost, guests are putting health and safety first. Hotels can expect to see a 4x increase in questions around property restrictions and safety procedures. If your property can’t give a satisfying answer to how it’s keeping guests safe, your brand will suffer: 60% of travelers punished brands for being insensitive in their response to the pandemic.The guest of the future is also turning to social media to learn more about your hotel’s safety protocols, as well as room availability. RateGain found that 65% of Indian travelers prefer getting brand updates on Facebook. In fact, few travelers are turned off by brands that advertised during the pandemic – 92% of those surveyed by RateGain said they could understand the economic stress the pandemic caused and didn’t feel that it was inappropriate to advertise during the crisis.What does this mean for your hotel? The post-pandemic guest is looking for balance in the way your property communicates. More communication is definitely preferred – guests want to hear from your hotel regarding availability, safety protocols, and opening/closing restrictions. This guest wants your property to acknowledge the severity of the crisis and to show how your team is taking every precaution to stay open to travelers responsibly.This guest is open-minded when it comes to marketing messages; they won’t punish your property for continuing to run promotions, so long as you demonstrate you’re putting the guest’s needs first and foremost. On social media especially, your marketing team must strike the right balance between promotion and precaution.Building the Digital ExperienceBefore the pandemic, guests interacted with a hotel brand primarily through the physical experience (e.g., how comfortable was the bed?) and the service experience (e.g., how easy was the check-in process?). Now, there’s a third layer through which the hotel will leave an impression with a guest: the digital experience.All three pillars will be important to meeting the needs of the post-pandemic traveler, but hotels are currently least equipped to capitalize on the digital experience. The digital experience incorporates technology and online platforms to meet guest needs virtually – before, during and after their stay. The digital experience is the primary way to make a post-pandemic guest feel seen, heard, and cared for by the hotel’s physical and service experiences. Here’s what this means in practice.Drive Revenue by Prioritizing Guest SafetyIntegrating this digital experience with a property’s amenities and service offerings is key to driving revenue. For a general manager, winning the guest of the future starts by clearly following global health and safety standard operating procedures – and communicating these measures as transparently as possible using social media and email to win guest trust.Digital tools can simultaneously reduce variable costs at the property while meeting guest demand for social distancing measures. In your operations, implement touchless check-in and contactless room-service for your F&B team. Shut down buffet-style dining options and add healthy meals to your menu. Augment the service experience with immunity-boosting in-room snack options. And, evolve the physical experience by creating a safe in-room experience and offering a digital concierge. These measures both personalize the guest experience and drive revenue by supplying amenities that guests actually want.Sales and marketing teams should focus their effort on improving your hotel’s reputation using guest feedback. This team must communicate what is being done to improve safety at your property as well as to promote user-generated content, providing social “proof” that your hotel is being honest and transparent in its effort to keep guests safe. Harness positive customer reviews to win trust with travelers by showing, rather than telling. Make sure you’re regularly updating your social media profiles, OTA listings, and website with all precautions your property is taking.Finally, revenue managers will play an outsized role in attracting new travelers following the pandemic. New data from RateGain shows how the market has become much more dynamic since COVID-19 started:What do these numbers mean for revenue managers? The digital experience isn’t just for guests: revenue managers need a reliable rate intelligence platform that can integrate with your existing Revenue Management system to optimize rate shopping and monitor real-time rate changes, improving your price strategy accordingly. You also must be able to capture mobile-first guests – otherwise, you’re missing a massive competitive advantage.Three Ingredients to Attracting Post-COVID TravelersIt’s hard to know when the pandemic will be over, but it’s possible to start pivoting your hotel’s operations and outreach to be prepared for that inevitable eventuality. The new guest will expect to have consistent, positive service, physical and digital experiences with your hotel. Focus now on three key investments which will help your hotel win more bookings from post-pandemic travelers:By focusing on the digital experience, your hotel can drive revenue and increase brand trust with the first post-pandemic travelers.About the Author Kamesh Shukla \n\nExecutive Vice President – Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa\n\nRateGainSource:hoteltechreport.com",https://rategain.com/blog/heres-how-hoteliers-can-attract-new-travelers-in-the-post-covid-era/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Linkedin-no-cta.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Linkedin-no-cta.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,COVID19,,,,,,,0
65632814a3f6fc78b8eba208,-683850224,How Airline Revenue Management and Pricing Teams Respond to Revenue Volatility?,"December 15, 2020","The revenue management framework and the approach to pricing will have to unlearn and re-learn to adapt and deliver in the new realities. Restricted movements across the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic have severely affected the airline industry, making 2020 one of the worst years in its history since 9/11 attacks and 2008 global financial crisis combined. With an 85% decrease in global air travel, a report released by IATA recorded a loss of $84 billion in 2020 with an additional predicted loss of $15 billion in 2021, leaving the industry in a period of extended recovery at least until the year 2024.The complete disruption of travel in the last eight months has resulted in airline companies to realize that there would be an additional dependency on accessing, processing, and analyzing real-time market data to perform and succeed in the new normal. This also means that the revenue management framework and the approach to pricing will also have to unlearn and re-learn to adapt and deliver in the new realities which have no bearing to past learnings and approach. All of this has given rise to a new breed of post COVID airline revenue and pricing managers that face a unique set of challenges they have never encountered before, namely: performing in uncertain market conditions, delivering on customer expectations, identifying new source of revenue streams and improving yield.With airlines in an acute need of capital as they resume services in the new reality, the revenue and pricing managers need to work from the ground up to reorient the airline revenue management framework while dealing with volatile demand patterns, frequently changing government regulations, limited capacity and resurgence of infection waves to name a few. This means that the pricing and revenue management framework will need a change in their approach and working model in the new normal.Table of ContentsWhy is the problem bigger than before?Pricing played a smaller yet critical role earlier before OTAs and third-party partners came into play which put the focus on selling the “cheapest seat”. With the emergence of OTAs, the emergence of voice search options and mobile apps travelers now had the power of comparing prices in a few clicks thus making it more important for airlines to remain up to date always and be aware of competitor pricing strategy at all times. The rise of ancillary based offerings for the traveler makes matters more complicated for pricing managers to decide the right offer.However, the challeges of the post COVID airline revenue and pricing managers are very different from the above.They need to make pricing decisions much quicker keeping into consideration changing market conditions along with ensuring that they get information from the right channels, optimize routes based on demand, plug revenue losses on third party demand websites and optimize pricing strategy based on traveller sentiments, travel triggers and paying capacity. As a result, they cannot rely on old methods and pricing structures.RateGain understands the complexity involved in generating revenue in the post-COVID world and why airline revenue & pricing managers to change their approach to price tracking. To ensure the same we upgraded our competitor pricing intelligence solution, AirGain to enable revenue & pricing managers leverage a monitoring platform that tracks daily changes by leveraging forward-looking data in real-time and takes appropriate decisions that reflect market trends in the new normal.Real-time rate intelligence from appropriate sourcesThe post COVID revenue managers need unlimited access to end user-facing intelligence that allows them to track market changes in real-time.

65632816a3f6fc78b8eba20a,-1411587113,Revenue Volatility in Airlines is Here to Stay: What can Revenue & Pricing Teams do About it?,"December 15, 2020","With airlines in acute need of capital, revenue and pricing managers will need a change in their approach and working model in the new normal to reorient the airline revenue management frameworkRestricted movements across the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic have severely affected the airline industry, making 2020 one of the worst years in its history since 9/11 attacks and 2008 global financial crisis combined. With an 85% decrease in global air travel, a report released by IATA recorded a loss of $84 billion in 2020 with an additional predicted loss of $15 billion in 2021, leaving the industry in a period of extended recovery at least until the year 2024.The complete disruption of travel in the last eight months has resulted in airline companies to realize that there would be an additional dependency on accessing, processing, and analyzing real-time market data to perform and succeed in the new normal. This also means that the revenue management framework and the approach to pricing will also have to unlearn and relearn to adapt and deliver in the new realities which have no bearing to past learnings and approach. All of this has given rise to a new breed of post COVID airline revenue and pricing managers that face a unique set of challenges they have never encountered before, namely: performing in uncertain market conditions, delivering on customer expectations, identifying new sources of revenue streams and improving yield.With airlines in an acute need of capital as they resume services in the new reality, the revenue and pricing managers need to work from the ground up to reorient the airline revenue management framework while dealing with volatile demand patterns, frequently changing government regulations, limited capacity and resurgence of infection waves to name a few. This means that the pricing and revenue management framework will need a change in their approach and working model in the new normal.Why is the problem bigger than before?Pricing played a smaller yet critical role earlier before OTAs and third-party partners came into play which put the focus on selling the “cheapest seat”. With the emergence of OTAs, the emergence of voice search options and mobile apps travelers now had the power of comparing prices in a few clicks thus making it more important for airlines to remain up to date always and be aware of competitor pricing strategy at all times. The rise of ancillary based offerings for the traveler makes matters more complicated for pricing managers to decide the right offer.However, the challenges of the post COVID airline revenue and pricing managers are very different from the above.They need to make pricing decisions much quicker keeping into consideration changing market conditions along with ensuring that they get information from the right channels, optimize routes based on demand, plug revenue losses on third party demand websites and optimize pricing strategy based on traveller sentiments, travel triggers and paying capacity. As a result, they cannot rely on old methods and pricing structures.RateGain understands the complexity involved in generating revenue in the post-COVID world and why airline revenue & pricing managers have changed their approach to price tracking. To ensure the same we upgraded our competitor pricing intelligence solution, AirGain to enable revenue & pricing managers to leverage a monitoring platform that tracks daily changes by leveraging forward-looking data in real-time and makes appropriate decisions that reflect market trends in the new normal.What does the airline revenue and pricing manager need to do succeed in the new normal?Get Accurate Information from All Available SourcesThe post COVID revenue managers need unlimited access to end user-facing intelligence that allows them to track market changes in real-time. Access to end-user data from airlines and demand source websites will allow them to draw insights available from the market data and use them for improved analysis and recommendations.Leverage Data-based Insights To Make Intelligent Decisions FasterThe post-COVID airline revenue management will also need to safeguard their best performing OnD pairs as flights resume operations versus their competitor flights. The existing experiential knowledge will no longer hold value as the post covid era demand trends, travel triggers and market behavior holds no bearing to the past.Leveraging Technology To Reduce Effort And Improve EfficiencyAirlines need to possess the ability to deep dive into analysis in context to their business objects faster than ever before. The need to compare pricing offered by others with a single click and saving the hassle of looking through endless streams of data to detect actionable insights is the need of the hour to optimize pricing decisions faster and improve time to market.The way forward for airline companiesDue to the changing nature of the airline industry and the varying customer behavior, real-time rate monitoring is no longer optional for airline companies. There is a need for improved decision making, which can be implemented by accessing and analyzing real-time market intelligence data to draw actionable insights that can help revenue managers develop pricing strategies for the future.

65632817a3f6fc78b8eba20c,-1561593556,These New Car Rental Subscription Programs Will Get You There,"December 15, 2020","Donna Choate discovered a car rental subscription program by accident.She needed a new car, but she wanted to avoid the hassle of ownership — the auto loan, insurance and maintenance. Was there something that let her skip all of that?That’s when Choate, a podcaster from Atlanta, heard about Hertz My Car, a new option that’s billed as an alternative to vehicle ownership and leasing. For $1,100 a month, which includes the cost of the vehicle and basic insurance, she drove away in a new Infiniti Q60.“I loved the idea of having flexibility with a car,” she says. “I don’t worry about maintenance and basic insurance is included. When those are factored in, it can be less than owning a vehicle.”Table of ContentsAn industry shift to car rental subscription programsHertz, which earlier this month expanded Hertz My Car nationwide, isn’t alone. The car rental industry is gearing up to offer subscriptions to drivers like Choate who want transportation without the burden of ownership. They’re competing with car manufacturers, which already have well-established subscription programs.“A one-size-fits-all transportation approach just doesn’t work for customers anymore,” says Kyle Sabie, assistant vice president for Enterprise Holdings.Enterprise last year launched a similar program, Subscribe with Enterprise, in several U.S. markets. Sabie says Subscribe by Enterprise is part of an industry-wide shift in the car rental industry. Increasingly, auto rental firms see themselves in the transportation business and are trying to give their customers more options for getting around.Which rental companies are offering car rental subscription programs?Subscribe with EnterpriseThe program, launched in May 2019, gives its subscribers access to over 20 makes and models, with the ability to switch vehicles up to four times per month. It’s available in Minnesota, Missouri and Nevada. Subscribe with Enterprise also offers damage protection, vehicle maintenance, roadside protection and up to 3,000 miles per month. Pricing varies by state. In Minnesota, for example, there’s a $250 enrollment fee as well as a $1,499 monthly subscription fee.Hertz My CarThe car rental company’s new program allows subscribers to choose from three monthly subscription tiers, starting at $599 a month. That will put you into one of Hertz’s economy, compact or mid-size sedans while its other tiers offer SUVs, trucks, full-size and luxury sedans. The all-inclusive monthly subscription covers vehicle maintenance, roadside assistance, limited liability protection and vehicle damage. Vehicle damage protection isn’t included with the lowest tier, but you can add it for an additional fee.Sixt+Launched in September, the car rental company says Sixt+ is a flexible form of individual mobility. Its monthly rate, which starts at $459, covers usage of the car and vehicle-related costs such as registration, dealer costs and routine maintenance and service fees. You can return your vehicle after a month and swap it out for another one. If you want to buy the car, Sixt offers a credit valued at one month’s base rate of your Sixt+ subscription.New car rental subscription programs programs join a crowded fieldThe new car rental subscription programs join an already crowded field of subscription options. Car manufacturers took an early lead in subscriptions, with programs like Care By Volvo offering drivers an option between renting and buying. Care By Volvo is a 24-month subscription lease program, but you can cancel your subscription and return the vehicle any time after the first four months.Paul Chambers, CEO of the Subscription Trade Association, says subscriptions are growing in popularity. Manufacturers like Volvo launched their programs almost as an afterthought — for example, the launch of the Care By Volvo program was timed to assist with one of the company’s launches of one of its compact SUVs.“The program has been successful for them, and as subscriptions evolve, more companies are leading with it and fully integrating it into their business model, not just as an add-on,” he says.Which car rental subscription program is right for you?The car rental subscription programs are not widely available yet, and are so new that a true side-by-side comparison is difficult.The most obvious difference is in vehicle variety, says Richard Reina, the product training director at CARiD.com.“Subscription programs available through rental car providers allow access to models across a variety of car makers,” he says. “With a manufacturer subscription plan, you’re only able to select from that manufacturer’s lineup.”Availability is also a consideration, says Reina.“With Hertz’s latest announcement, their subscription program vehicles will be available nationally at any of their corporate U.S. locations,” he says. “Most of the manufacturers are still only piloting these offerings in select cities. Enterprise is in that boat as well, with car subscriptions only available in Minnesota, Missouri and Nevada.”New car rental subscription programs are based on demandWhen considering a car rental subscription program, it helps to know a little about what’s happening behind the scenes. Car rental companies design these programs based on local and inbound revenue forecasts.“Subscription models are designed by revenue managers based on the business plan and targets for the specific year,” says Anup Dhiraj, director of car rentals for RateGain, a provider of travel and hospitality information.That means your subscription program can change from year to year, and even month to month, depending on demand.There are some drawbacks to subscription programs. In most cases, a vehicle subscription is more expensive than traditional vehicle ownership or leasing, says Melanie Musson, who covers car subscriptions for the car insurance site CarInsuranceComparison.com.“The increased monthly cost is worth it if you have the budget for it and you decide it’s worth the peace of mind that a subscription brings,” she says. “With a subscription, you’ll always have a late model vehicle that works well. If the vehicle causes you trouble, you’ll get a new one.”Ultimately, you may be better off with another transportation option, according to Brandon Barron, a frequent traveler who works for the timeshare exit company Linx Legal.“You can cancel most any car reservation without penalty at any point,” he says. “So why lock yourself into something that you may never use properly?”How to decide if a new car rental subscription program is right for youShould you consider subscribing to a car through a car rental company? Here’s how to decide:Do it if you:Don’t do it if you:Car rental subscription programs are just starting to rev up. Rental companies will add options as they evolve into transportation companies.About the AuthorChristopher Elliott is the founder of Elliott Advocacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that empowers consumers to solve their problems and helps those who can’t.

65632818a3f6fc78b8eba20e,-775015555,"Pardon me, your politics are showing","December 12, 2020","EXCLUSIVE: New data suggests a widening red state/blue state travel divideAmerica doesn’t just vote along party lines. It travels on them, too.That’s the conclusion of a controversial new study by RateGain, a software company that specializes in travel. It crunched hotel reservation data for Thanksgiving week and compared it to the same period a year ago.And what it found was surprising. The red state/blue state divide extends to travel — and it might do more than change your next trip. It could also affect you if you’re locked down in your own home, trying to stay healthy.Table of ContentsWhy this mattersI think RateGain sent me this information as a dare. Why? Because no one in their right mind would wade into this controversy, especially when nearly half the country thinks the last presidential election was rigged.But this booking analysis may be useful. And besides, I’m not afraid of a little controversy.Let’s take a look at the electoral map as of this morning:<img width=""1286"" height=""828"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/https-_bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_a97f77ab-a0b8-481a-8033-2f5184690031_1286x828.png"" alt="""" />This is not an endorsement. I’m only showing you this so you can see the red and blue states. More on my politics in a moment.Here’s the RateGain map, along with their decrease by state. The red states are down, but not by that much. The blue states show a more significant decline in bookings. The only exception is Georgia.<img width=""1076"" height=""670"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/https-_bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_54d8188b-9425-4d9c-a3f0-e67a56258681_1076x670.png"" alt="""" />The maps are very similar, aren’t they? Blue states and cities recorded an 82 percent drop in hotel bookings for Thanksgiving 2020 compared to the previous year. Red states are not seeing as much of a decline, with 2020 levels at just 40 percent of what they were in 2019.Check out the citiesBut the pattern doesn’t become clear until you drill down to the cities.<img width=""1240"" height=""744"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/https-_bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_4de1a949-0881-4601-8ab2-23ec5246f40a_1240x744.png"" alt="""" />Traditionally blue metropolitan areas like New York, Chicago and San Francisco are way down from last year. The cities aren’t all solidly Democrat, but close enough.And here are the cities with the lowest declines:<img width=""1240"" height=""686"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/https-_bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_93cc322c-a5d5-4b94-a1ec-82536ee25673_1240x686.png"" alt="""" />Again, there are a few blue cities in the mix. But there’s definitely a trend.I asked RateGain what it made of the disparity.Chinmai Sharma, president of RateGain, says just as the country has different views on politics, it also has different views on travel and travel safety:We are witnessing that blue states or cities, which are largely dominated by Democrats, have seen a big drop in bookings this week.Some major cities recorded up to 82 percent drop in bookings, showing solidarity and support with the government’s position of limited travel and maintaining social distancing protocol.Red/Republican states are not seeing a massive dip when compared to 2019 levels averaging only around 40 to 45 percent drop.What this means for youIf RateGain’s trends continue, it could affect your next trip. I might have second thoughts about visiting Jacksonville, Fla., in the coming months — although, to be honest, Jacksonville sounds nice right about now. Today’s high temperature is a balmy 79 degrees.Politics affects the way we travel, of course. I covered this topic four years ago in my USA Today column, and some readers hated it. (Don’t believe me? Just read the Facebook comments.)But other people’s politics may affect you even more. I cover dangerous destinations regularly. An unstable political situation can make a place hazardous to your health even when there’s no pandemic.My advice is still the same: Follow the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and avoid travel if possible. If you live in a red state, please bear in mind that your neighbors may not be heeding the guidelines (and vice versa, if you’re in a blue state, they may be). No guarantees, of course.Plan your activities accordingly. And please stay safe out there.Do you think there’s a red state/blue state divide in travel? I’m opening the comments on this post, but please be kind.

6563281aa3f6fc78b8eba210,-354823823,"New Deal Europe Weekly Update on Tourism to the Balkan Region, Week 24","December 12, 2020","RateGain software helps businesses to stay competitive and capture business in these challenging times (Photo of Thessaloniki market by H Kakarouhas).Table of ContentsNews from travel technology: RateGainThis week we look at the role of travel technology and how it can help organisations to win business and stay competitive in the post covid environment. We talk with Barcelona based Fritz Müller, Vice President of Enterprise Clients at RateGain. Thanks to their extensive data collection software, he is perfectly positioned to review travel trends, and interpret what they mean for travel companies who want to capture business in these challenging times. Are we looking at a future price war or are there alternative strategies…?NDE: Hi Fritz. Thanks for talking with us today. Can you explain to our readers what RateGain does and what your role in the organisation is?FM: RateGain offers a range of Distribution, Business Intelligence and Social Media services to the entire Hospitality & Travel industry. It is our aim to connect all sides of the industry, and to provide transparency too, enabling our partners to make well informed and strategic decisions about their presence in the marketplace, what pricing to adopt, and what distribution channels to use. I am personally in charge of maintaining and growing the relationships with the Global Enterprise Clients of RateGain, which comprises the biggest OTAs, Tour Operators and Wholesalers in the world. In my role I combine both Sales and Account Management to offer a holistic service to a pre-defined set of Enterprise clients. It is very exciting to be working with some of the biggest travel names in the world and I am learning a lot each day.NDE: So RateGain helps hotels and tourism businesses with their distribution and with their pricing. Which of these is the most important right now?FM: I am of the opinion that pricing is not driving more demand at this moment. Currently, demand is affected by confidence, or fear, and by restrictions that are put in place by governments. Therefore, the answer has to be distribution, as a strong distribution network will enable hotels to attract a wider mix of clients and therefore increases the chance to reach the clients that are still allowed to travel, and have the confidence to travel. I recommend all hoteliers to review their current distribution mix and consider contracting channels that they formerly opted not to work with.Currently, demand is affected by confidence, or fear, and by restrictions that are put in place by governments.NDE: Focusing for a moment on pricing, how has it changed over the last year?FM: Pricing has significantly changed over the past year, but it has been a mixed bag across the board. Firstly, there has been a big drop in pricing and I have seen multiple cases where 4-star hotels are suddenly competing with budget hotels for the same customers. At the same time there are hotels who have not decreased prices at all. During this summer, when travelling was possible again, to some extent, domestically, hotels in leisure regions were charging prices that were higher than last year. The hotels were banking on the fact that clients would crave travel and want to disconnect. There are very few cases where we have seen a market level occupancy increase as a direct result of the market dropping prices. We are being told by partners that people who feel safe travelling are motivated by the desire to travel and rarely due to the price point.<img width=""700"" height=""467"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-Deal-Europe-Weekly-Update-on-Tourism-to-the-Balkan-Region-Week-24-1-1.jpg"" alt="""" />During this summer, the key changes in demand came in a shift from international travel to domestic travel (Photo of Maribor, Slovenia by Tourism Maribor).NDE: There has obviously been a major change in availability and in booking patterns this Summer, brought on by Covid, and I presume you must have had to adapt very quickly to the changes in the market. What would you say are the key changes in demand and in the market segments right now?FM: It is fair to say that every company, especially in the travel industry, had to adapt to the impact of Covid-19. With our DHISCO platform we have a deeply integrated distribution platform that connects the biggest chains in the world to the biggest channels in the world, and therefore gives us very interesting insights into the booking patterns globally. Demand is very volatile at this moment and is impacted and driven by the ever-changing restrictions of each country and region, plus influenced by news of vaccine roll out plans. The key changes in demand came in a shift from international travel to domestic travel. We’ve also seen how leisure travel has been driving demand over the past year due to corporate travel declining — and is yet to pick up.NDE: Competitiveness is key to successful sales, but hotels, travel companies and tourist boards say they don’t want a price war, and want to focus on added value packages. Is this a realistic strategy in the current climate or is the consumer just looking for price over added value?FM: I do believe that added value offerings can make the difference for most clients. We have seen many hotel partners creating ‘out of the box’ packages with local complementary companies to drive increased awareness. As we are in the midst of not only a health crisis and a financial crisis but also a crisis of confidence it is important to give customers that confidence back. Packages and flexible booking terms are a way to spark more confidence in the mind of the traveller. That said, realistically, a price war is unavoidable as a lot of hoteliers are fighting for their existence. Every occupied room, even slightly above break-even, goes a long way to survival until we have a new normal.As we are in the midst of not only a health crisis and a financial crisis but also a crisis of confidence it is important to give customers that confidence back. Packages and flexible booking terms are a way to spark more confidence in the mind of the traveller.NDE: Given this situation, and the current market dynamics, how important is it for a hotel to continue with rate monitoring? Should they continue or is this a thing of the past?FM: I have called pricing a mixed bag in a previous answer. Rate monitoring becomes even more important in this current climate as we are seeing more dynamic and more extreme price changes than usual. We have also noticed that rate changes are happening more frequently than before, so rate monitoring should no longer be a once a day process but should be done multiple times per day.<img width=""700"" height=""466"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-Deal-Europe-Weekly-Update-on-Tourism-to-the-Balkan-Region-Week-24-2.jpg"" alt="""" />Having the right distribution channels activated at the right time is crucial for any travel business. (Photo Facebook Dubrovnik Riviera)NDE: Many of the hotels and tourist boards, in the Balkan region, which we have spoken to and interviewed have told us that they have survived this year thanks to local markets. Consequently, they are concentrating promotional activity on markets which are within driving distance. Clearly you are seeing this trend too, so how can RateGain support this local v global strategy?FM: Yes, we do see this trend for domestic travel across the board. It is somewhat encouraging that even in these extreme circumstances people are still travelling. With Government restrictions in place the only chance to travel is within your own region or country unless the customer is willing to quarantine upon return. Naturally, most of travel is therefore domestic. RateGain can help here with our distribution network, by giving easy access to all relevant channels that are driving local demand at this moment. Also, Social Media becomes more and more relevant in this context. With BCV we have a Social Media service for hotels that drives engagement with targeted audiences and ultimately creates demand from set audiences.Good content, campaigns and community management can create more direct bookings in the future and increase the live time value of each customer.NDE: This is maybe a good time to talk about the role social media plays in driving demand. Right now, which of the Three C’s — content, campaigns, connectivity– do you believe is the most important in keeping you competitive as a hotel or as a travel company?FM: There is no one answer to this question. Connectivity is still at the base of extending your reach as a hotel and will be key, especially when the markets are opening up again, but content and campaigns are really important at this point as they whet the appetite of the travellers and get them to dream about their magical next trip. With BCV, we are creating content and campaigns for our clients. One key focus that our hotel clients have is to build the customer base of tomorrow. This should still be a consideration for all hoteliers. Good content, campaigns and community management can create more direct bookings in the future and increase the live time value of each customer.<img width=""700"" height=""483"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-Deal-Europe-Weekly-Update-on-Tourism-to-the-Balkan-Region-Week-24-3.jpg"" alt="""" />RateGain has launched MarketDrone to monitor changes in the market as they happen. (Photo VisitSofia Facebook)NDE: Looking to the future, adaptation and innovation is key to long term success, for any business, but is particularly pertinent in the fast moving world of travel technology. What are the key pressures brought on by the crisis, which you have seen within your field and how has your company adapted and innovated?FM: There is more pressure on rate monitoring and also on having the right distribution channels activated at the right time for the right hotel. On the rate monitoring side, we have launched MarketDrone which is a mechanism that constantly monitors rate changes in the market and feeds them to the hoteliers as they happen. There is no need to rely on scheduled reports that arrive once a day, or worrying if and when to request a new report, as MarketDrone catches changes at any time. Relating to finding the right distribution channels we have launched SmartDistribution for our channel manager, RezGain. Smart Distribution monitors the productivity of all channels that are producing in a hotel market, and suggests new channels to hoteliers based on the production stats that these channels have with similar hotels in the market. Both launches are aimed to help make hotel decisions faster, easier and better informed.\n\nImage for postQuestions by Robert Dee, co-founder of New Deal Europe, the only travel market platform dedicated to generating business to the Greater Balkan region of Europe.

6563281ba3f6fc78b8eba212,-99066400,See the Green Shoots of Recovery with Smart Distribution’s latest addition “Future Demand”,"October 21, 2020","Skift Global Recovery Index, which provides granular insights on travel and hospitality industry recovery, shows that currently, we stand at 42% recovery compared to last year. The recovery index is growing week-on-week, but it is still a long journey ahead. The COVID-19 pandemic has left the Travel and Hospitality industry in a state of disturbance, confusion, and uncertainty. The challenges faced by hoteliers are multi-faceted. In simple words, it can be put as to how to survive, recover, and grow.The primary objective for most hotels right now is survival. Once hotels have solved for survival, they have to again create their distribution strategy from the scratch. The well-defined goals & focus areas created between Jan to Mar 2020 might need a complete overhaul. To add to the problems, historical data might not be the best tool to forecast & take decisions. The new norm in terms of planning is “The last two weeks for the next two weeks.” This makes it very important for hoteliers to have real-time market insights to plan on their recovery strategy. With this intent in mind, we added “Future Demand” insights to our “Smart Distribution” offering.Before proceeding on how we can help hoteliers with some trends around “Future Demand,” let us recapitulate Smart Distribution.Table of ContentsSmart Distribution for HoteliersRateGain’s distribution platform that includes AI-powered Smart Distribution, provides access to 1,500+ demand partners. It helps enterprise as well as independent and smaller hotel chains with new demand discovery, performance benchmarking with similar hotels, expedited new channel onboarding, 80% reduction in manual mapping efforts, 900+ tour operators connectivity, real-time enterprise analytics, and future demand insights. In one of my previous articles on PhocusWire and a video with HSMAI, I discussed on Smart Distribution at length. However, to conclude, the automation and innovation provided by Smart Distribution simplifies distribution and drives incremental revenue, which makes it a powerful tool that can be used for recovery from COVID.<img decoding=""async"" style=""display: block; border: 0;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/journey-1.png"" alt="""" width=""100%"" />The idea is to make it extremely easy for our hotelier partners to understand basics like:It’s an honor when the UN’s specialized wing for tourism, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), recognizes your focused efforts to solve Post-COVID challenges. UNWTO has declared ‘Smart Distribution’ as a solution that helps the industry in driving demand recovery and address UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 3, 8, 9 and 17 that aims to provide decent work, economic growth, enable partnerships and drive innovation.Say Hello to Future DemandDuring these difficult times, as is evident from our discussions with multiple customers, The distribution strategy needs to change everyday basis new protocols, COVID growth stats, opening up of airports/countries, and several such factors.

6563281da3f6fc78b8eba214,-1773317370,Seven Tactics to Keep your Hotel's Distribution Healthy and Highly Profitable,"October 7, 2020","Efficient distribution is fundamental for the long-term health of your hotel chain. Getting each property’s inventory in front of the right guests at the right time at the right price means that you can convert more guests and enjoy profitable revenue management.Managing distribution efficiently requires a unique skill that combines a nuanced approach with a deft touch and a data-driven mind. It is a superpower really; the ability to tailor your distribution so precisely that you maximize your revenue opportunities on all channels all the time. However, that’s always easier said than done. The continued complexity of distribution can make it quite difficult to manage effectively and profitably.Technology has simultaneously contributed to this complexity (by reducing start-up costs and making it easy to launch new channels) and made it much easier to manage (by seamlessly connecting supply to demand). Given technology’s prominent role in distribution, it’s always worth periodically revisiting your approach to optimization.Table of ContentsA Few Ways to Optimize your DistributionTo assist you on your daily revenue optimization journey, here are seven helpful tactics. You may choose to implement just one of them or you may be ready to go full tilt and focus on improving the quality and health of your distribution connection. Either way, incremental improvements mean big gains over time. The key is to stay focused and make sure that you are using the right technology to amplify and not hinder your efforts.1. Metric, metrics, metrics! A little repetition never hurts, right? You’d be hard-pressed to find a revenue manager or hotel professional that doesn’t understand the power of metrics. Yet, when it comes to evaluating different distribution channels by performance, key channel-level metrics can be difficult to surface. Without access to relevant metrics, such as bookings, cancellations, ADR and RevPar for each channel in your distribution mix, you’re optimizing with one hand tied behind your back. And if your distribution connection provides this data on a delay, or the data is unreliable or inaccurate, it’s worse than having no data at all.Channel-level metrics matter deeply to your distribution strategy. Be sure that you are getting all of the data you need to evaluate the contribution of each channel to your overall distribution strategy.2. Know your look-to-book stats.Another valuable metric that’s worth pulling out on its own is your look-to-book ratio. This shows you the proportion of people that make a booking after looking at your hotel chain. Of course, you have access to this insightful metric in your direct channel. You can use it to optimize your website, tweak your booking flow and test new offers and promotions. With each test, tweak and interaction, you can monitor how it affects your look to book. The more lookers you convert, the more bookings you get — and the more revenue you take in.But what happens on 3rd party channels? This information is not easily obtained. You have to rely on each channel’s approach to data analytics. Whenever possible, you want to find this information and pull it into any discussions around distribution strategy. As you identify highly-converting channels, you can assign more inventory and incrementally optimize your distribution over time.3. Benchmark to your compset at the channel level.Benchmarking your hotel chain allows you to see what similar properties are doing with their distribution strategy. You should compare and contrast key metrics, like total bookings, ADR, RevPar, cancellations and channel mix. These benchmarks help you make more accurate pricing decisions, identify underused or overlooked distribution opportunities or discover new channels for experimentation. With a careful eye on the competition, you can be one step ahead of the game!4. Opitmize your switch cache. All too often, hotel chains overlook the power of cache optimization when they are connected to distribution partners via an intermediary such as a switch. This can lead to dramatic under performance, as your switch cache greatly influences how intermediaries access and onwardly distribute your inventory. Whether you deploy a push, pull or hybrid approach, your switch cache is the backbone of your distribution. A poorly-performing switch cache can be the root cause of an underperforming distribution strategy.Proper switch cache monitoring revolves around a regular review of your switch cache settings report. You should be looking at the accuracy of your switch cache, as well as its speed and overall utilization. Certain distribution channels may prioritize higher-performing switch caches and you don’t want to get left behind by your competitors’ better-optimized switch caches. As you measure and improve your switch cache’s performance, you’ll see greater accuracy, faster performance and fewer missed bookings due to outdated switch caches. Better switch cache accuracy would mean no difference in prices between pre-booking and final booking page, which would result in lower dropout rates. Optimizing switch cache would reduce the load on the CRS thus protecting it from any outages and also freeing up bandwidth for connecting to more demand partners.5. Review your error data report often.Errors can impede even the most thoughtful distribution strategy! So, in addition to your cache report, regularly review your error data report. These are like cheat sheets, showing you exactly where you need to jump in and take action. Errors play a critical role in determining your connection quality. Every error that occurs could have been a confirmed booking and fixing these errors would result in direct spike in bookings received from existing channels.DHISCO Insights provides a clear view of what channels are causing the most errors, the type of errors that are generated and the properties that experience high error percentages. This allows you to directly zero down on the issues and fix them right away. Fewer errors mean fewer missed booking opportunities! It’s an easy way to boost conversions and make more money for your properties.6. Monitor CRS and connectivity performance.Your CRS performance offers a direct view into how well your connections are optimized. There are two metrics to monitor when measuring CRS performance: overall response time and the individual response time at each point in your system. Watch for the response time in both your chain’s CRS and your connection partner, so that you can pinpoint opportunities for improvement.You’ll also want to monitor how well other CRS systems are performing so that you can have a clear benchmark. With that frame of reference, you can know just how well your CRS is performing compared to others and identify any issues before they start to impact bookings.7. Leverage channel-level intelligenceFor hotel chains, channel-level intelligence offers insights into top performing channels on a property-by-property basis. Armed with this data, you can carefully analyze each channel’s contribution to your business. Since these patterns can change quickly, keep an eye on channel performance on a daily basis and optimize accordingly.Remember that analyzing the performance of each channel in your chain’s distribution mix ensures that you are getting the most out of your connections. To further optimize connections, dive into your channel-level intelligence to understand which channels produce the most, which channels contribute to most of your traffic and which channels produce the most errors.Knowing When to Try Something NewAs you focus on channel optimization and efficient distribution, ask yourself whether the quality and health of your distribution connection is affecting your overall return on your investment. If you find that your distribution connection hobbles your optimization efforts, then you may find that it’s time to try something new.Distribution is complex but your technology shouldn’t be. There’s no reason to suffer through poor connections that hobble your revenue management strategy. We’re certainly biased — but the right technology will assist you in optimizing your distribution for maximum profitability.

65632820a3f6fc78b8eba216,294772570,Bespoke Strategies for Opening the Doors to the European Market,"August 25, 2020","Table of ContentsMantras for SuccessThe most preferred way to succeed is to choose a ZigZag path, and that means learning from various roles. One should get into a position, squeeze out the most from that, and then move to another one to learn something new. Doing this will eventually lead to the identification of the most appropriate role. Persistence is key to success. Showing tenacity and endurance helps us in the market place by preparing well for the future. Timing is everything. One must have the patience to wait for the right timing to make things happen.Encounters with Hard TimesCOVID-19 is not the first hard time that Bespoke has witnessed. The first encounter of Bespoke with a hard time was when it was first set up 20 years ago with the Mad Cow Disease. Travel had stopped. It resulted in a business loss for three months. Post this, Bespoke Hotels have also gone through times of SARS, Avian Flu, and Recessions.Business ManagementTalking about UK business, Bespoke had a mixed ride. They have closed down all of their hotels, sent 5,000 employees on leave, borrowed money from the government, and worked very hard to pick up other pieces of business. Bespoke recently signed off a deal to help some of their other hotels that would have otherwise gone busted for COVID reasons. They plan to restart these hotels in the coming winter. The first three will open in August, and then the opening of the remaining 40 hotels will eventually follow. Bespoke is calibrating every hotel and is taking a measured approach for reopening hotels.Revenue ManagementBespoke has several deluxe properties, and they are amongst the first to reopen. They do not find pricing an issue for these properties. In mid-markets, hotels are price-sensitive, and Bespoke is changing the rates and functions daily. Considering the North and South corners, Bespoke has got five coastal hotels. It is looking at top-end hotels enjoying occupancy that is even higher than the last year same time with room rates being the same. Bespoke has a different dynamic for the mid-market hotels as these hotels are dependent on event-lead activities. As events are not happening currently and hence, these hotels are struggling.Health and Safety ProtocolsBespoke has prepared a comprehensive manual that they possibly could, and have been doing numerous online and practical training for its employees. There are documents in place that enlists the principles and guidelines for health and safety measures. In all of their hotels, it has displayed the security measures along with dos and don’ts.There is no correlation between price and health & hygiene facilities. The customers are checking the availability at a destination, and they are taking it as a given that health & hygiene facilities will be of the best quality. This expectation cascades down from a luxury hotel to an ordinary one.Distribution StrategyBespoke acknowledges the business that OTAs bring. However, they will hold out direct bookings from the hotspots for the upcoming few months. They will allocate certain bed counts to OTAs and will manage the rest via direct bookings.Corporate and Digital StrategyBespoke operates on a central hub corporate strategy where they spike out things from the center. While it runs on a hub and spoke model, it also emphasizes creating local heroes. In such cases, they let the local facilities operate while providing necessary support from the center. When it comes to digital, Bespoke is doing quite a bit of activity on Google Ads and other digital platforms. They have become reasonably professional when it comes to operating on social platforms like Facebook. They have not utilized the power of Instagram yet but are working towards it.Technological Changes Post COVID-19Bespoke is working on giving more power to their website and trying to make it mobile-friendly. In terms of Artificial Intelligence, they are working on a couple of pilot themes with much more AI influenced booking mechanics. For internal communications, they have an app that ensures that all the internal departments are connected seamlessly. They are using walkie-talkies but interested in switching to mobile devices.Spotlight:Bespoke is opening a new 88 bedroom hotel called “The Telegraph” this October, with the soft opening taking place on 23rd-24th October in Coventry, England.About the Author Harmeet Singh \n\nCEO\n\nRateGainHarmeet Singh is the Chief Executive Officer at RateGain.

65632821a3f6fc78b8eba218,-435479558,A New Era of Exploration is Coming to Hoteliers. Stay Tuned!,"August 20, 2020","In the past, exploring opportunities in new source markets and demand channels came with both risk and time-consuming implementations on the part of the hotelier. To start, the exploration in itself was challenging, blind, and often left to vague promises and hope. It was hard to know what channels were producing, what the real target audience was, and what their buying power was. In simple words, “is this audience a good fit for my hotel, and will the revenue generated be worth the investment in time?”Also, with many new and upcoming channels, as well as the number of new channels added, maintenance can become a severe headache for hoteliers. To give an idea, in brand hotel website the direct booking cost is $2-$5, whereas, for independent hotels, the cost per booking is $8.5- $12.5. Also, direct online bookings are 10-12 times cheaper than OTA bookings [1]. Constant monitoring of channels to ensure accuracy may not be feasible or would require a larger team to monitor the channels manually.But this era of uncertainty may very well have come to an end. When RateGain acquired DHISCO in 2018, we did so with a clear vision on how switch technology and channel management could bring synergies to hoteliers by leveraging the strengths of each other. We knew that we had a unique opportunity to solve for the battle between push and pull models favoured by hoteliers and demand channels equally. Being customer-centric, it is in our DNA to always listen to the customers and understand their goals and challenges. Over the years, we zeroed in on a few key trends common to almost all hoteliers:Table of ContentsAccuracy is everythingIt’s no secret or surprise that the vast majority of hoteliers prefer the push model of distribution while demand partners prefer the pull model. Each model significantly favours either the hotelier or the demand partner disproportionately. Until now, there seemed to be no middle ground. But with DHISCO’s push technology leveraging cache and Change Discovery Services (CDS), both hoteliers and demand partners maintain 99.9% accuracy, without a high load on CRS systems, with no missed booking due to time-out, and a 20-100 millisecond response time.How is this possible you might ask? Caching and the concept of storing data with an intermediary is not new. And while it does help offload pressure on hotel CRS systems. But accuracy was still an issue, as the cache didn’t know when to refresh. With DHISCO and RateGain’s Change Discovery Service, one can leverage artificial intelligence to keep the cached data fresh, by looking for patterns as well as using shopping data to look for changes. With over 2,50,000 hotels and alternate lodging properties in our database, we process over 200 billion transactions per month. Why does this matter? Artificial intelligence needs data to improve and become smarter. This vast network of customers, large and small, is what has allowed DHISCO’s distribution network to be the most accurate and the fastest. To summarize, here is a snapshot of the Connectivity quality that DHISCO Switch provides.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Infoigraphic-1.jpg"" alt=""Advantages of rategain"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />Distribution for differentiationIn any industry, differentiation is highly critical, but especially in the hospitality industry where customers have fully emerged in the experience the hotel offers. But as you cater to niche traveller segments or want to tap into emerging source markets, you also have to tap into the marketplaces used by these travellers to book trips. These emerging marketplaces can cater to certain geographies, traveller demographics, or a specific type of properties. In the past, connecting to these “long-tail” sites was not worth the investment in time and money. But this all about to change. Here at DHISCO, we’ve invented and gone LIVE withShop-to-Push technology with one of our large hotel chain partners opeing up the landscape of long-tail demand channels.This new connectivity opens up opportunities for large chains to distribute to over 300 new channels previously unavailable via the switch. Firstly, it drastically reduces the implementation time if you are connected to the switch. Secondly, DHISCO can customize your connections to fit your needs. In other words, you can optimize your plans to ensure high cache accuracy. The large chains are already seeing this as a game-changer. It is especially true for chains with a deeper regional distribution strategy that leverages strong local channels to drive demand. Lastly, having access to both the top demand channels and long-tail channels with one provider will eliminate the need for a mix of distribution technologies (switch, channel manager, direct) to manage. DHISCO Connectivity also provides a Direct Push mechanism that can be customized to connect to 1,500+ channels in a complete push mode. Also, it comes with the ability to handle billions of transactions seamlessly in push mode.Introducing Distribution Insights & OptimizationAs I’ve laid out, having a stable and reliable distribution network, and having the freedom of choice to craft the perfect mix of demand channels is critical. But how do you know what is working? How do you know that your connectivity is stable and producing? How do you know which demand channels are performing in different regions? DHISCO has always monitored connectivity and communicated transparently with our customers, but now you no longer have to take our word for it. As we introduce DHISCO Insights & Optimizations, all the intelligence is at your fingertips. Leveraging the world’s broadest inventory of connected properties, now you can get insights on:Top/bottom performing brands, geos, properties and OTAs Brand performance compared to similar brands in the same markets and how different OTAs produce for other brands Monitor connectivity health and identify areas to optimize and thereby boost bookings Drill down into key metrics to identify areas of opportunity or risk<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Infoigraphic2-1.jpg"" alt=""Advantages of rategain"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />Of course, all data is kept anonymously and aggregated to protect customer data and confidence. This is available in an intuitive dashboard format and can be consumed in a preferred format – Excel/Daily Mail Subscription/Browser.The new normal just got betterThere is risk, uncertainty, and our options feel limited in the world we are currently living. It doesn’t mean your distribution has to be the same. As we open our doors, dust off the linens, and start welcoming guests back into our hotels, let’s put our best foot forward as travel returns. At RateGain, we link our success directly to that of our hotel and OTA partners. Our customers told us they care about the accuracy and stability of their distribution channels. They want a better choice with faster implementations and insights to make better decisions. Working with key clients, we are excited and honoured to introduce the fastest and most reliable distribution technology to-date, with more options than ever. Let’s welcome travel back – together.One of the largest US based chains wanted to switch their connectivity partner for one of the largest bed-banks in the world. With over 4,000 properties to be migrated worldwide and the channel being one of the most critical for the chain, the migration had to be seamless.

65632823a3f6fc78b8eba21a,2109980328,Perspectives with Saurabh Prakash: How Hotels Can Get Digital Right for Recovery,"August 14, 2020","Go back to your last vacation! I, of course, don’t intend to make you feel bad, but think of why you planned it? Who told you about the attractions? Places to visit? There is a 50-50 chance that you either got inspired by Instagram or were influenced by a friend who went for that trip. However, with the situation changing so dynamically, it is difficult to plan based on the experiences shared by our loved ones.This, of course, is a cause of concern for Hotels as bookings, and traveler intent scores are not in sync. According to Skift Recovery Index, while traveler intent in the US, Canada, Germany, Russia, and China is going up, it is not correspondingly translating into bookings, in the Asian market we are witnessing a double whammy, wherein significant markets like India traveler intent is low as well as recovery.Digital Marketing teams in hotels are neither able to show the latest reviews nor are they able to share on property festivities or post UGC to engage guests and drive bookings. Therefore I thought of asking an experienced marketing and revenue leader on my next fire-side chat to get his perspective on how hotels can use digital to get recovery right. I was fortunate that Saurabh Prakash was able to help me with some of the answers. Saurabh is a Certified Hospitality Digital Marketer with over 20 years of experience across leading hotel chains that includes Radisson Hotels, Marriott, and currently leading Marketing functions globally, including Brands, PR & Communications, Digital Marketing, eCommerce Platforms, Loyalty & Distribution teams for Millennium Hotels & Resorts.For all marketers and hospitality leaders, you can get digital right for recovery with the following insights from Saurabh that he observed and executed at Millennium hotels and resorts.Table of ContentsHow To Adjust Your Digital Strategy?As hotels look to curtail spends, Saurabh discourages hotels to only rely on in-house teams as they will always have limited experience when compared to external partners that also have lessons from other industries. The right partner would have expertise from different sectors to acquire customers and ensure that your inhouse team challenges those ideas constantly.In a survey we did with over 200 APMEA marketing leaders, 25% of them suggested that they would allocate up to 50% of their marketing budget to social media marketing while 30% of the respondents said they would allocate up to 35%. As a marketer, it has been a challenge to get budgets approved before COVID-19, and hence I was interested in knowing from Saurabh how marketing leaders can approach this and what components they should include in their strategy to convince their owners to get budgets?1-Be the First RespondersDigital is about time to market; it makes It extremely critical to not only reach your target audience but also to reach them first, with your unique brand message and not appear as ‘YET ANOTHER.’\n\nSaurabh shares with us that Millennium was one of the first brands to identify the coronavirus pandemic and start a campaign around health and safety by February 17th, which was at least one month in advance of all other major chains, making It easier to engage their loyal audience as well as prospective guests and also communicate that as a group they are ready to make all the right adjustments to welcome their guest.Saurabh tells us that his team translated this operational change by geo-targeting members and non-members who could drive to our hotels from neighboring countries or cities. While this tactic might look sensible, he further tells me a statistic that fundamentally changed the way we view the traveler in the new normal. According to Google, the keyword ‘STAYCATION’ has surpassed ‘OFFER’ in terms of searches as of June 30th. ‘OFFER’ was the highest searched keyword by travelers for the last five years; however, can my team rely on ‘STAYCATION’ and continue to target the audience, absolutely not. One of the biggest learnings we have had is to be more nimble, agile, and ready for the change and then go to market with a strategy.2-Nimble Budget AlignmentAs per Saurabh, in an average year, 40% of the budget was spent in upper funnel activities such as the creation of demand, SEO, social and performance marketing, and 60 % in lower-funnel to drive PPC and other engagement activities.If hotels, today are struggling to keep the balance, hotels can choose to change this to 75% to 25%; however upper-funnel activities are not done only to build immediate demand but to engage the guest for the long term and drive conversions, and therefore hotels should not move entirely into the lower funnel. The need for nimbleness is paramount to adjust the funnel between months to drive cash and then again adjust back to focus on upper-funnel activities to drive engagement.He further suggests that marketers should not position themselves as Cost of Sales but look at it from an ROI perspective, instead of saying you spent $14 for every $100 sale, we can say that we had 7X ROI. Things might have changed during COVID, but providing a new perspective still works.3-Re-Invent Content by Keeping One Core MessageRe-invention will be critical to reaching our customers, and if we continue to do what we were doing earlier, we will miss our results. Budgets would be challenging to get, and hence it is essential to invest in a single campaign and continuously take that message to your audience instead of launching multiple content pieces.4-Align Your Offers to Your Brand Strategy As demand stays down, giving offers or discounts would not be prudent as it leads to lesser cash, also if each property or market rolls out different offers, then you are diluting your brand message and setting them up for uncertainty as we do not know how each offer would resonate.5-Experiment with New TechnologiesSaurabh also suggests that hotels should look at technologies not used by digital marketers today as restrictions continue, but the need for having an experience increases. According to him, Augmented reality would be one trend that will be used in social soon to help guests experience hospitality right from their devices.6-Don’t Forget ReputationOne of the lessons Saurabh shares with us is that during his role in Millennium, where he defends that while managing reputation is part of operations however it is critical to make it part of social media marketing because it gives us a window into consumer sentiment which is a vital marketing KPI. He further shares that today, 60-70% of buying behavior is based on online reviews, and therefore not actively investing in social media monitoring is a critical mistake hotel chains can make as they look to recover.Saurabh shares a small example that they executed at Millennium Hotels and Resorts. The team did not wait for customers to flood their reservation teams or social media with a request for cancellations, but proactively renamed their cancellation policy to flexibility policy and communicated the same to their guests to indicate that we are FLEXIBLE. In addition to this, they made all rates flexible and removed non-refundable rates.The last lesson of the day Saurabh told us about was at this critical time when budgets are challenging, ATL is out of the question, companies should leverage the power of EGC or Employee Generated Content to connect with your target audience to increase brand salience.The lessons shared above revalidate what we have been hearing from other marketing leaders in the last few months namely –I will continue to share lessons from eminent leaders like Saurabh in the future to help hospitality leaders, managers and professionals to not only learn how to act in this crisis but also for professionals who are seeking new career opportunities to get first-hand insights to be able to be better prepared for new opportunities and move towards a #BetterTomorrow.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/PS1Rz7qthbY"" width=""100%"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>About the Author Apurva Chamaria \n\nChief Revenue Officer\n\nRateGain Apurva Chamaria is the Chief Revenue Officer of RateGain, one of world’s leading SaaS company’s serving over 20,000+ customers in the travel and hospitality industry across 100+ Countries.

65632824a3f6fc78b8eba21c,3777123,Perspectives with Debojo: How Survival Became A Success Metric at SpiceJet,"July 22, 2020","Week after week, I have these conversations with leaders to get a chance and understand how you turn a crisis into a success. For this week’s fireside chat, I was rather excited to host my guest owing to the immense scope of learnings that I would get to learn from talking to Debojo. An old friend, Debojo, has been busy for the last decade on some of the most ambitious marketing projects executed in India. He became an entrepreneur at 26, providing digital solutions to diverse industries from Education, Healthcare, Travel, and hospitality post, which he also headed the Marketing Function at Common Wealth Games. Finally, he joined SpiceJet, and since 2016 has been working with its current owner and make it one of the world’s leading airline stock. A multi-lingual, energetic leader with over 19 years of experience. A pioneer among marketing leaders, who have gone beyond their role and managed other initiatives and driven them to success.Table of ContentsDealing With Crisis is Not New to SpiceJetDuring the coronavirus crisis, most of us have seen that SpiceJet has been actively working with the government in these tough times and operated close to 25 flights, as part of the Vande Bharat mission to bring back over 4000 Indian nationals, stranded in the Middle East. They also started charter flights to bring back over 30,000 Indian nationals and pivoted to carry Cargo and deliver essentials across the world.This Entrepreneurial DNA at SpiceJet is not new, and its roots can be traced back to the change it experienced in 2016 when the airline was about to become bankrupt. It’s owner, Mr. Ajay Singh, infused cash and took control of its operations.Making Survival A Success FormulaReminiscing those days, Debojo shares that one of the biggest challenges that the airline faced was to gain customer confidence as the crisis was internal, but the impact was on the end customer. They had a limited amount of fleet, and the government restricted us from taking any future bookings. The first three months in 2016 were all about survival, and by April, the effort of the commercial teams saw the airline have the highest load factor in the country with an occupancy factor of 88%.Debojo did not credit this success to only the commercial teams but to the culture that also drove the engineering and operation teams on the ground that helped in improving SpiceJet from number 5 to the number 1 airline in On-time performance, dislodging our competitor whose positioning was OTP for the longest time.Making Marketing Work During A CrisisTheir approach to marketing at the time was also careful and calibrated. As many hotels, airlines in the post-COVID world, look at a relaunch strategy, I believe SpiceJet’s example from 2016 can serve as a simple framework to plan the relaunch strategy. At that time, they experimented with digital channels and continuously targeted in reaching new audiences with new content to increase awareness, after they had reached enough people and started seeing engagement, they shifted to Print Ads to position the airline as a stable and well-performing industry player.\n\nHe further adds that the essentials of marketing continue to remain the same, understand the customer, know who your audience is, and have the right metrics in place. What has now changed is how we communicate this message. According to him, the three things marketer should invest in to get success areIn the specific instance of COVID-19, we had to move from the promote mode to listen mode, very quickly, and tailor our communication in accordance with the queries our guests have. Leveraging technology, we could provide a chatbot that helped guests get answers to as many COVID19 questions that they had. The time we saved from answering those queries were invested in communicating about canceled tickets, credits, and how the same can be used in the future.<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfIxmE6F73s"" width=""100%"" height=""380"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>Moving Forward without relying on historical dataDebojo states that India has always been a price-sensitive market, and SpiceJet has stayed ahead of the curve and our competitors. While some practices in revenue management might take time to change and it might be some time before the industry adopts a new framework on arriving at the right pricing, the interim time will see brand salience playing a crucial role combined with the safety measures taken. Almost 20% of the consumers in India are looking to pay a premium if an airline ensures better health and safety, which has never happened in this market before.Innovations That Build Trust to Get Travelers On-BoardSpiceJet is continuously investing and innovating to make the experience safer and seamless. Initiatives around health and safety such as synthetic-leather seats that would make sure no virus, microbes, the dust gets attached to the same as its not porous and make cleaning easier. This also extends to SpiceJet’ new in-flight entertainment system where they are testing safety features,\n\nTo my utter surprise, Debojo shared an insight, which most fliers are unaware of. According to him, the air circulated within the plane is the cleanest when compared to any other form of transportation. The airflow is from ceiling to bottom as a gush to ensure that you do not breathe the same air, and the entire air is refreshed 30 times in an hour.\n\nSpiceJet is also working with partners to ensure that the entire experience from entering the airport to check-in, onboarding is contactless to ensure zero contamination. Today, Air Travel is the safest mode of transport.Opportunity for Brand Sites to Increase DirectGuliz Ozturk from Pegasus earlier this year, told us about the opportunity brand sites have to increase bookings by consistently communicating with passengers and making sure that the right information is timely available to travelers, so that they rely on your website to not only book tickets but also make sure they get the right experience when they travel.\n\nWhile Debojo principally agreed with Guliz’s idea, he argues that the direct booking phenomenon is prevalent in the west, where some airlines also have stopped distributing on other channels and take bookings only on their website.\n\nHowever, India’s aviation industry will rely on third-party partners as they have captured most of the market and can offer discounts to consumers that we cannot afford.Our conversation concluded as expected, with Debojo being optimistic about SpiceJet’s future and the aim of the management to expand in international markets, which other foreign airlines are no longer able to service, due to reduced demand and increased operating costs.\n\nMyths cleared, hope restored, and lessons learnt. The journey of capturing perspectives continues to help professionals in the travel and hospitality industry understand how better can they cope in the new normal.\n\nIf you liked reading this and are interested in getting more perspective, visit this page.About the Author Apurva Chamaria \n\nChief Revenue Officer\n\nRateGain Apurva Chamaria is the Chief Revenue Officer of RateGain, one of world’s leading SaaS company’s serving over 20,000+ customers in the travel and hospitality industry across 100+ Countries.

65632825a3f6fc78b8eba21e,-1962723275,Strategies for Hoteliers to Get Back to Business for UK Market,"July 20, 2020","The panel featured Sally Richards, Managing Director Raspberry Sky Services Limited, Shona Whitehead, Managing Partner Cogent Blue, Doug Greenwood, Director of Sales and Marketing, Cheval Collection, Alan O’Riordan, Co-Founder Apaleo, Claire Rowland, DirectorThe Afro Marketer and was moderated by Maarten Edelman, AVP & Head of UK RateGain®. The agenda consisted of the current market situation in Europe and UK, changes in distribution landscape, revenue strategies, trading through the pandemic, evolving technology and essential marketing for a successful relaunch.Table of ContentsThe Current Scenario: Market Insights from Europe and UK Market Recent figures on net bookings show an upward movement that brings to the industry a huge sign of relief. A 175% rise since the lowest point in net bookings in mid-March is witnessed. Though both show a positive incline, OTAs lead the way ahead of GDSs in terms of net bookings growth. Gross bookings continue to be stagnant in Baltic, France and Monaco while the rest of Europe observes an uptick. Much of this stems from the leniency of the government in each of these countries and how effectively they have re-instilled a sense of trust in their people in such uncertain times. CRC reveals Germany, UK and Netherlands as the top 3 markets for intra travel.Distribution Landscape Changes: Diversification, Content and Technology For distribution strategy, one must understand the geographic source markets and segments before determining the hotel distribution channels and products. We are now witnessing the international travelers moving towards Staycations. Companies will continue to work from home but there will be an emerging demand for local company getaways and retreats for strategic meetings. GDSs and corporate booking tools must continue operating to pick up all domestic and international business. As source markets and segments shift, it is critical to align products with customers. Highlighting key information like flexibility in bookings, lenient cancellation policies, revised rate plans and descriptions are of utmost importance. As advance purchase rates hold no significance anymore, hoteliers should look into special packages and rebuild loyalty with value-based products. To narrow down on distribution channels, understanding the acquisition costs and the true costs of sale by each channel must be done. The motives of an interacting customer have changed from conducting transactions to now simply exploring and dreaming. Content and marketing should reflect that. As voucher-based OTAs garner popularity, they present an opportunity to Hoteliers as they look for inventories and packages. Companies like Expedia and AirBnB have already launched programs like the Expedia Review and Relief Program. This time should be taken out to review and update textual content and ensure a sense of sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the needs of the customer. Right connectivity can enhance customer journeys and reduce costs.Revenue Strategies: Best Practices & Plan Technology will spearhead the powering of the revenue management systems as the industry adjusts to the new normal. However, the need for human capital persists. The revenue manager is needed to truly grasp the nuances of this constantly evolving industry. RMS Data continues to be relevant now. The eminent opportunities presented by staycations in domestic markets must be capitalized. Automating the process, recalibrating systems and eliminating maximum manual processes will be the way forward as the industry adapts to a pandemic stricken world. Establishing a well-defined medium and long term pricing strategy should be the basis of making revenue management decisions. Time must be taken to reinforce team confidence and trust. Enthusiastic testing and learning from different pricing strategies and using upselling tools can be rewarding. Identifying the new customer and staying customer-centric will help in avoiding knee jerk reactions to the evolving scenario that would otherwise prove to be very costly.Trading through COVID-19 and lessons learned Rewinding to March, there were still some long stay and transient customers in the market looking for fully equipped service apartments. Cheval Collection was one such company that took on a lot of this business. The people from initial repatriation and people with a terminating lease looking to move as soon as possible turned towards service apartments. A significant portion of the work-from-home population that wanted to ensure better working facilities also became their clientele. Managerial decisions to handle the influx of guests in these trying times involved breaking the teams into two and allowing alternate weeks off. The welfare of customers and staff was maintained as the priority. In these times, the Cheval app proved to be extremely useful as it gave the customers an option of remaining contactless. Health and safety continue to be of paramount importance because of which several measures like quarantining of delivery boxes, digital check-in and out etc. should be offered. Reassuring customers, working collectively and safely is going to allow the industry to power through Covid-19.Technology Changes due to COVID-19 In the last few years, deliberations around introducing new technology to help with the guest journey and improving efficiency have been on the rise. Making the guest experience contactless, digital, efficient and simple is the need of the hour. Though debate around the feasibility of kiosks and screens that require constant cleaning persist, the option to go digital must be offered to all guests using new technology. Providing guests with the ability to opt-in or out of cleaning as per their requirements, isolating deliveries, maintaining digital interactions etc. should be looked into as we approach normalcy. An increase in demand for real-time trending data to be used as analytics tools has been observed. While upgrading to newer technology, one must keep in mind the ability to manage their systems and the capacity to scale up and down as per their requirements.Marketing: Digital Essentials for a Hospitality Relaunch Safety and health must be prioritized. Communicating safety policies and measures must be done effectively and distinctly. Reassuring the customer, instilling a sense of collective responsibility and highlighting safety protocols is essential. Once open dates are announced, there will be a leap from negligible activity in the market to a saturated market that is going to cause hotels to make a lot of noise. It will then be critical to differentiate which can be done by effective communication with the people, not just customers. Invest time and resources into understanding the people’s problems, concerns, views on eating out, travelling etc. Specialized and unique packages like those targeted around family reunions, pet owners and corporate retreats are a good idea to market your business. A hotelier’s focus must always be on direct sales. They should capitalize on what OTAs lack that is clear and concise information on cancellation policies, booking flexibilities etc. and gain the consumer’s confidence. It is also the time for them to switch back on their online presence. Be real, be relatable and share. People may not be ready to jump the gun and buy but it is a crucial time to inspire them. Homing in positive reviews that are fresh and pertain to current situations can be very beneficial. Old reviews will not hold the same weight anymore so customers should be encouraged to review and share and BCV, a RateGain guest experience cloud platform will help in it to manage all these things.In these difficult times, the industry must work collectively and make effective decisions. Working towards building safe and functional strategies and ensuring their immediate yet careful implementation can allow the industry to make a successful recovery and set in motion a promising trajectory.About the Author Maarten Edelman \n\nAssociate Vice President-Sales\n\nRateGain\n\nSocial Media & Distribution Expert with 16+ years of experienceCertified Business Administration & Management executive from Hotel Management School Maastricht, Ex Micros Fidelio and TravelClick.

65632827a3f6fc78b8eba220,-1478600695,Strategies for Hoteliers to Get Back to Business for Europe Market,"July 20, 2020","Currently, the world is at a standstill as the Novel Coronavirus sweeps the globe. In such times of crisis, productions are halted, investments are low, risks are high and demand has dropped. The pandemic has not only ensured tremendous business loss but gross economical and financial loss as well. No industry is immune to the virus and the several consequences that come with it. One of the worst-hit has been the travel and hotel industry. This webinar focuses on Hoteliers in the Baltics region and strategies to bounce back amid this crisis.The discussion panel comprised of Janis Valodze, CEO & Founder Hotel Dog Hospitality Consulting and Advisory, Martina Lichorobiecova, Director- International Markets, Mevris Hotel Systems, Theodoras Katsimpras, Director Global Business Development, Bookonlinenow, Christiane Sievieking, VP & Head of Baltics & Eastern Europe, RateGain®, and was moderated by Mark Haywood, Senior Vice President & Head of Europe RateGain®.The agenda covered the latest industry-related news, need for modifying distribution landscape, upgrading hospitality technology to create engaging customer experiences, strategies to increase direct bookings, transitions into reopening, and was followed by questions from the viewers. Demand trends in both Greece and Czech Republic exhibit an upward positive movement. This is a great sign for the industry as requests in 2020 seem to be returning to normalcy.Latest News and Current Happenings Currently most hotel businesses are closed and the occupancy rate is a mere 1-2%. However, borders are opening up between the Baltic countries, bringing hope and respite to hoteliers. Inbound tourism is on the rise as weekend travelling surges during this time. Capital cities were used to international traffic which is yet to recover but the regions are beginning to thrive with inbound tourism. Hotel Dog Hospitality Consulting lays absolute strong focus on safety & hygiene protocols and effective communication should be placed.There can be seen a potential rise in the domestic travel for the incoming summer period. Demand will be contingent on external factors like flights, ease of movement between borders etc. The entire industry must work together to gain back the traveller’s trust and create a safe experience for them. In such uncertain times, adapting to new source markets and target groups might be a good strategy. RateGain pointed out a potential shift in the type of demand and feeder markets. Restarting businesses should look into the review of hotel distribution channels and partners, creating content that is current and creative, cancellation policies that are updated to adapt to current times and give guests a sense of ease and ensure technology is being used to its maximum potential.The importance of technology and the need to stay updated is a major area of attention in social media marketing. It allows for a unique and engaging experience with guests, an increase in income and reduction of costs. Saving time, having fewer errors and assuring a guest-friendly experience that is in alignment with brand style and values can help in boosting revenue. Mevris Hotel Systems believes in the need for sustainability and suggests carrying out online payment procedures for the same.As hotel businesses are on the road to recovery, Bookonlinenow shares key factors to home in on. There is a need to focus on direct bookings. This could be through dynamic pricing and offers, social media campaigns, value-based reward system, meta search activation, operation of chatbots, use of customer data and more. Adopting new technology and marketing strategies along with analyzing the new demand will be essential to assimilate into the changing tourism and travel landscape. Keeping content and website up to date with safety procedures, cancellation policies, reopening dates, service offerings etc would also allow hoteliers to prepare for reopening.For a successful and profitable reopening of hotels, short term activities that steer in the right direction can help achieve the long term goals. Safety communication, review of travel distribution and technology, fresh content and loyalty schemes are some measures that can aid the process of transition in these tough times.The poll conducted with the viewers reinstated the importance of content, automation and flexibility. It was reinforced that dropping prices is not always an effective game plan. It doesn’t create new demand but only helps steal existing demand. Working on value-added services and fostering a unique and engaging experience with guests that allows for differentiation can assist the survival of businesses in this increasingly competitive market without having to slash prices. As for independent hoteliers and BnB’s, establishing a strong online presence and investing in hygiene, distribution and communication are a must.\n\nAs the situation evolves, businesses must take the right steps and adjust to the changing environment. Effective measures executed rapidly with utmost discipline and care can make Hotel and Travel recommencement in the Eastern European market successful and profitable.About the Author Christiane Sieveking \n\nAssociate Vice President-Sales\n\nRateGainShe is Associate Vice President of Business Development & Partnerships at RateGain Technologies and has more than 10 years of experience in E-Commerce, Business Intelligence, Revenue Management and Distribution.

65632828a3f6fc78b8eba222,1679985794,"Perspectives #8 with Ajay Bakaya, Managing Director, Sarovar Hotels and Resorts","July 14, 2020","As Executive Director of Sarovar Hotels for over 20 years, Ajay Bakaya has played an integral part in the magical growth story of Sarovar since its early inception. Stemming from a shared office and leadership of a single hotel, he has championed tremendous growth of a portfolio of 90 hotels in more than 50 destinations. Sarovar brands now include Sarovar Premiere, Sarovar Portico, Hometel, Golden Tulip, restaurant brands Geoffrey’s and Oriental Blossom, and a dozen of Radisson hotels that it manages.He is a degree holder from IMHI Cornell-Essec Paris and the Oberoi School of Hotel Management. He has won several accolades and awards and has paved the path for mid-market hotels in India. I had the pleasure to host him and received valuable insights and knowledge on the Travel and Hospitality industry.Table of ContentsThe Untapped Potential of 3-4 star Hotel MarketThe hotel industry in India was a completely different landscape 25 years ago when Ajay joined Sarovar Hotels and Resorts. Now catering to the mid-market hotel demand, he began his illustrious career with a luxury hotel background. There existed a giant gap between luxury and budget hotel segments with minimal offerings. The timing worked favorably as very few players in the 3-4 star range operated in those times. His journey began in humble conditions when he worked alongside his team in an office space that he shared with others. What set him apart, even when his professional career was still quite young, was his reputation for integrity and performance. Hopping from Goa to Agra and then landing in the Marine Plaza in Mumbai, he was able to establish a broad base. With 68 suites to sell, he exceeded all expectations and over-delivered. Following shortly, Carlson Hotels had some software requirements, and that opened the door for the association with the Sarovar group. They came out with Sarovar Premier and Sarovar Portico in the early 2000s. Up until then, Ajay had excelled in handling other brands, however now he faced a new challenge of building a brand from the ground up. Today Sarovar group is all set to have 100 hotels under their belt by 2021.The Underlying Belief of the Sarovar BrandWhen starting a management company, it is critical to know that from where the funding will come and who would be the investors. The investors or owners are kings, but one must think and act like them to be successful. Fostering long term relationships and realizing that the concerns of the owner supersede everything else is crucial. The three pillars of support holding up the philosophy of the Sarovar brand are having a strong base of resources and an exceptional team, offering the owners what they cannot attract or retain, and having the independent ability to bring in customers.Expansion into New Territories Sarovar has around 30 properties at different stages of construction spanning temple and pilgrimage sites to more commercial areas as well. Approximately six projects will get delayed by 6-12 months, while the ones still at the infancy stage might get pushed further. Pilgrimage sites are becoming a critical part of the development circuit as Sarovar continues to explore this territory more.Sarovar has also expanded successfully into the African continent and achieved a huge milestone in its growth journey. With firm roots in Nairobi and Lusaka, it reached the goal of replicating the Indian story in the African landscape. After a decade and a half in Africa, the Sarovar establishment in Lusaka has become the top all-suite hotel in Zambia, far ahead of its name-brand competitors. New projects are also extending to Ethiopia and Somalia. Their focus has been on the eastern, English speaking countries of Africa like Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Kenya.A Match Made in HeavenThe recent partnership between Sarovar Hotels and Resorts and the Louvre Heritage has been like a match made in heaven. Though they own a majority share of the Sarovar brand, they recognize its brand value and strength. They have full independence while developing both the Indian and French brands in India and beyond.The Roadway to RestorationSarovar Hotel and Resorts caters to three key segments in the hospitality industry. Sarovar Premiere addresses the upscale category, Sarovar Portico to the 3-4 star mid-market range segment, and the Hometel Hotels to the budget 3-star division. As far as the ARR is concerned, hotels across all three categories took a beating of anywhere between 20-50%. Luxury hotels will take longer to recover. It stems from the fact that their core market is primarily older travelers and those more established in life who are less likely to venture out just yet. Furthermore, the fixed costs of large luxury properties are higher, taking them longer to break even operationally. The younger traveler would be more open to taking chances and resuming with everyday life. Hence, the mid-market will respond faster.Segment-wise Demand CreationThe business clientele of Sarovar Hotels constitutes 65% of their inflow, while leisure traveler makes up for the rest of 35%. Many pundits have hypothesized that leisure will pick up much faster than business. Opening up of the tourist hot spot Goa and its performance will ultimately prove or disprove this theory. For Sarovar, both fronts have been sluggish, but they are actively working towards bringing in demand. Eventually, normalcy will return as people cannot work from home forever, and hence, corporate demand will rise again.As people opt-in for smaller weddings in the current scenarios, they are turning to hotels as they offer much lower overall costs. The government is actively requested to modify the crowd limit according to the area and size of venues. It shall bolster wedding demand even further.The Sarovar group was also amongst the first to offer spaces to doctors and hospitals in need, and many businesses followed their footsteps.Guidelines to Run the Food & Beverage Business for Total Revenue ManagementPricing and revenue management in the past has been very focussed towards room revenue, food and beverages, banqueting and how to optimize revenue within those offerings. In a time like this, where a lot of new ancillaries are opening up, food delivery is one such area that is a fresh territory for hotels above the 3-4 star segment.Quality accommodation has always topped the priority list of any hotelier, especially in India. So traditionally, the food and beverage offerings have lagged significantly in Indian hotels. The last two decades have seen independent restaurateurs posing a threat to hoteliers prompting them to pull up their socks. Failing to provide the same level of innovation and presentation when it comes to food makes a lot of hotels lose out on big business.For Sarovar Group, a large chunk of the revenue that is 20% comes from banqueting and an additional 20% from its restaurants. It has successfully built brands like Oriental Blossom and Geoffrey’s. Though they have no desire to franchise these or branch out into independent restaurants, their formula for renowned quality hotel restaurants has stood the test of time.While everybody seems to have hopped on the delivery bandwagon, one should ensure that they are adapting to the audience they want to cater to. Changing the offering to suit the environment one is serving and catering to that local taste is critical to stay afloat in such uncertain times. Sarovar Group is continuously reimagining and reengineering its offerings to provide the best-suited experiences. One must take into consideration the location and income bracket to map out the feasibility of such services.Handling Prices amid a CrisisTraditionally, the conventional route to setting prices was through historical data using STR reports, demand compression and using competitive price intelligence for hotels. Now that a crisis has swept the globe, all these tools are of no help. Inventories are not under the control of hoteliers, so it is the market that will decide where to take the prices. It is all free play as the customer can choose from plenty of options. An aggressive approach is required. Maintaining isolated rates in the market will never pan out. One must adjust to the evolving situation at all times. As prices inevitably take a beating, hoteliers must stress upon reassurance of the guests.The Distribution AmalgamationThe distribution channel management strategy and mix will change along with the changing world. 25% of the business of Sarovar Group continues to be serviced offline in 13 of its sales offices. Attempts to maintain this high percentage continue, as they keep their offices active and operations running. In time to come, an increasing amount of business will shift to online as every player in the distribution chain goes digital too. Direct sales are difficult and require strenuous efforts, but it does bestow the single substantial scope of growth potential. Sarovar has multiplied these numbers in the last few years. It is vigorously working towards growing the same.Adherence to Healthy and Safety Protocols Sarovar Hotels & Resorts have set in place intense online and offline training to prepare its employees for the Health and Safety protocols. Matting at the entrance, sanitizers accessible everywhere, regular cleaning of elevators, gloved and masked staff, touchless technology, and others are some measures that are adapted to allow for a safe experience for guests and employees alike.As procedures go contactless, reception desks will soon become a thing of the past. Regular checking and follow-ups to ensure safety and hygiene standards are met and conducted. The steps to adhere to guidelines are in place, but more importantly, they should be clearly and precisely communicated to guests to gain their trust.Boosting Employee MotivationFurthermore, when a disastrous economic situation prevails in a country where there is already an absence of social security, there is a lot of fear and uncertainty. Keeping the employee morale up has to be of utmost importance in such trying times where salary cuts and layoffs are bound to happen. Individual engagement and inspirational communication are critical in keeping your team motivated.Future of the Hospitality Industry The players exiting an industry in a crisis induces a drop in the supply of quality assets. For 2020-2025 things are expected to slow down in the hospitality industry significantly. Projects early in their inception stage will be placed on the back burner. All ongoing projects will be delayed. Those already halfway through must focus on going positive as soon as possible, as loans will continue to loom over the industry. The next five years shall witness 85% committed supply come up.Talks with hotel and travel associations have been underway. The priority demand has been of waiving off loans for the first year. It will lessen the burden significantly, especially for the up and coming entrepreneurs in the industry. Concerns were brought up in all states regarding the continual license fees, property tax, and others being charged to hoteliers when their businesses are closed. Utility bills must be calculated based on actual consumption and not on connected demand or minimum consumption. Though the varying degree of sensitivity towards the matter has emerged, many officials have been quite receptive and helpful.These were excerpts from the leadership series called “Perspectives” hosted by RateGain as part of the #BetterTomorrow initiative to track the performance of the hospitality industry and assist in developing coping strategies during this time of crisis.About the Author Apurva Chamaria \n\nChief Revenue Officer\n\nRateGain Apurva Chamaria is the Chief Revenue Officer of RateGain, one of world’s leading SaaS company’s serving over 20,000+ customers in the travel and hospitality industry across 100+ Countries.

65632829a3f6fc78b8eba224,97639249,Re-Taking The Skies : What Can Commercial Teams Do To Gear Up For A Full Return Of Airline Travel In The New Normal,"June 30, 2020","COVID-19 disrupted all economies and had momentarily seized cash-registers from ringing with airlines expected to lose $84.3 billion in 2020 for a net profit margin of -20.1% (IATA). Airlines all across the world witnessed a nose-dive due to the pandemic-induced-lockdowns. Realizing the prolonged impact the contagion is bound to inflict until an antidote is developed, many countries are trying to restore normalcy with the virus in the backdrop. And, as WHO rightly puts it, “We have all got to learn to live with this virus”.The new normal for airlines would fundamentally mean that commercial teams, unlike earlier, need to be nimbler, revisit existing partnerships, rethink the intelligence they have for maximizing opportunities, and redefine revenue generation. What challenges do they have to overcome for realizing this change?Table of ContentsThe challenge of historical dataThe new normal has effectively made all historical data redundant, making it extremely stressful for airlines to efficiently forecast demand and price in a unique environment like this. Future actions can no longer be based on the now-redundant historical data or system forecast. Airlines will not be able to follow a fixed way of doing business. They will need to evolve with the emerging scenario.Micromanagement of the inventory, regardless of what the inventories have been including hotel room, car rental, airline seat, or others, has to be taken into consideration. We also need to look towards the government regulations proactively. New rules and regulations will have to be accounted for in the new normal.Airlines cannot have fixed future prices or schedules, as there is considerable uncertainty. The carriers who operate ten flights a day between two destinations may reduce it down to 2 to 3. Normals in different countries will govern demand. Therefore, more than ever before, airlines today need reliable forward-looking competitive intelligence to make the right decisions.The blurring lines between Full-Service and LCCsLines between full-service and low-cost carriers could become blurred. There are certain times of the year when there’s no real difference between the full-service and low-cost carriers. A similar situation is going to happen because the demand and capacity ratio has completely changed. Airlines might not be able to offer ancillaries or deploy extra capacity due to social distancing. Hence, the full-service carrier might curtail its Business and First-class and play in the same field with low-cost airlines because of the capacity crunch, increasing the importance of accurate information in these uncertain times.There has to be very careful coordination between the information that is flowing into the revenue management system and the information which is already there. This is because there could be a dramatic shift in passenger behavior at various points of time.\n\nAll the previous data we have built up over the years for robust forecast and optimization will have to be thoroughly assessed. Though the systems will learn the process over time, they will be required to be adjusted as per the new parameters and information. The price is going to be determined by the market and not by incidents. The immediate focus will be on recovering what airlines have lost in the last few months.Redefining OTA-Airline relationshipThe OTA-Airline relationship will continue to be an essential ingredient in revenue generation, in the new normal, airlines would have to refocus and realign this relationship for success. Four factors will mostly govern this:What commercial teams should doRoute planning: The route planning at present involves several challenges. Most of them are due to the uncertainties in the crisis timeline, fleet plan, demand, and customer behavior. Ideally, plan for multiple scenarios as the situation is unprecedented, and we do not have historical reference points of this scale. It is best to know the geography (including demographics) and refer to the data pertaining to it (including the latest outbreak and containment patterns).Doing so will help in creating a dynamic operational framework that accounts for both macroscopic and microscopic trends. For each scenario, ensure there are multiple capacity plans in place. We can consider five broader demand recovery scenarios having V, U, prolonged U, L, and W recovery curves.Identify Demand Centers: Identify new and emerging demand centers by adopting a data-centric approach to find the next pocket of opportunity and monitor easy indicators of demand strictly, such as forward booking. Make sure to review your forecasting models as they might be misleading in the new scenario, and also have a real-time view of your competition.Agility in Network planning: Nimbleness in route planning will need support from multiple stakeholders. While scheduling teams will have to create and validate, the crewing team may have to change flight patterns, and slot teams will need the airport approvals. A more frequent roster change is also possible.Change Fare monitoring Approach to get real-time intelligence\n\nForecasting the demand has become a new challenge which has placed a renewed importance on the job of Revenue Managers (RMs). The revenue managers should be more attentive than ever and should focus on three points:The demand will not come back immediately. However, commercial teams have an opportunity to re-engineer systems to work for you and be ready for any crisis in the future. If airline revenue managers need to improve decision making and take decisions faster, airline companies need to make a conscious decision of moving away from inflexible partners that are unable to eliminate guesswork and show agility in responding to the dynamic needs of their partners. Some of the world’s fastest-growing airlines that work with RateGain® employed this strategy even before the pandemic hit us, making sure their market position was always better than their competition, it is time for every airline to make this the new normal.About the Author Shweta Vashishth \n\nVice President\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/re-taking-the-skies-what-can-commercial-teams-do-to-gear-up-for-a-full-return-of-airline-travel-in-the-new-normal/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-Aviation-Banner.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-Aviation-Banner.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Airline,COVID 19,,,,,,0
6563282ba3f6fc78b8eba226,-254648802,React to Competitive Prices in Real Time with RateGain’s OPTIMA MarketDrone,"June 15, 2020","MarketDRONE, the World’s only real-time cognitive rate intelligence solution, tracks the intra-day rate and rate plan changes by competitors in real-time and surfaces them to the revenue manager on the go on a device of their choice be it their smartwatch or a mobile. Moreover, we at RateGain (a leading travel and hotel revenue management company) are delighted to share that HSMAI Europe has awarded our OPTIMA MarketDRONE product with the Best Technology Innovation of the Year during their annual ROC and Awards in London on January 28th, 2020.With MarketDRONE, stay on top of the competitive landscape while focusing on what matters the most, i.e. improving business and boosting profits. We realized that the revenue managers need flexibility and responsiveness that comes from mobile notifications. The product pings mobile devices and wearables with instant alerts so that revenue managers can act on intra-day rate changes immediately. So let us look at five ways of how Market DRONE can help to boost hotel revenues and make revenue manager’s life better.Table of ContentsMaintain rate competitivenessThe average hotel changes its rates around 3 to 4 times each day. To stay competitive, revenue managers must adjust to changing dynamics continually. Sadly, traditional rate shopping does not solve for the pace of change in today’s revenue-managed environment.Our data has shown that a revenue manager, on average, may lose $1,000 or more each day by not acting quickly on intra-day market changes. That’s equivalent to an annual loss of around half a million dollars. With this rate analysis software, saving this loss is possible!Enjoy the rewards of always-on artificial intelligenceTraditionally, rate shopping software solutions have always struggled with archaic pre-scheduled rate shop reports, which have to be sliced and diced in Excel. During the time that revenue managers stare at a spreadsheet, the competitive scene changes at a rapidly fast rate around them.This market intelligence for hotels can identify market trends and keep revenue managers in charge of their revenue destiny. By identifying emerging patterns, both at the hotel and in the local market, you’ll have a more accurate understanding of market dynamics to guide your decisions. AI automatically rolls up the market trends so revenue managers can skip the traditional data slicing and dicing. Patterns and market insights emerge without as much effort, thus providing a better revenue management strategy.Save time by reducing manual tasksThe traditional way of working includes – pre scheduling of reports by the revenue managers followed by spending a significant chunk of the day analyzing daily changes in the market to determine the appropriate response.Moreover, revenue managers also have to analyze the performance of those decisions to judge the impact and then input those learnings into the next round of price adjustments. This method is quite cumbersome, error-prone, and time-intensive, thus affecting business goals.The above method always puts revenue managers on the road of burning coal. The process puts enormous pressure on revenue managers, who often feel like they must double-check their analyses.The instant alerts with the help of MarketDRONE provide market insights instantly, which means revenue managers can take the recommended actions on the go. Thus, making the decision-making process easier. OPTIMA MarkeDRONE observes the market for you and pushes real-time rate change notifications to a device of your choice.Easy-to-use and simple to understandOne of the benefits of push notifications is that they are quite familiar and easy-to-use. Everyone has experience with this type of information, and with notifications pushed to smartphones, tablets, wearables, and desktops too, there is no new process to learn.With an easy-to-navigate interface, technical users and businesses can gain access to instant market information availability. The system also learns with time without any additional inputs from the team. That means less training, ongoing maintenance, and certainly, no data uploads!Freedom from deskRevenue managers often spend too much time managing manual updates and approving rate changes within a desktop revenue management solution. Mobile notifications untether you from your desk! Whether you are doing a property tour without worrying about missing a market change or if you forget to bring your laptop home from work, these notifications go wherever you go.Rather than spending hours after hours, hunkered over a computer screen reviewing pre-scheduled reports, the system monitors the competitive landscape and pushes notifications of rate changes in real-time.Effective revenue management involves making strategic decisions, improving business, and boosting profits. With our MarketDRONE, revenue managers will be able to have an eye on the market, so no competitive movement goes unnoticed! By leveraging, the power of this AI and ML powered solution, revenue managers can stay on the path to profitability, no matter where they are in the World.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sandeep-singh.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" /> Sandeep Singh <img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nSenior Vice President – Product Management\n\nRateGain{\n\n  “@context”: “https://schema.org”,\n\n  “@type”: “BlogPosting”,\n\n  “mainEntityOfPage”: {\n\n    “@type”: “WebPage”,\n\n    “@id”: “https://rategain.com/blog/react-to-competitive-prices-in-real-time-with-rategains-optima-marketdrone/”\n\n  },\n\n  “headline”: “React to Competitive Prices in Real Time with RateGain’s OPTIMA MarketDrone”,\n\n  “description”: “OPTIMA MarketDRONE, the world's only real-time cognitive rate intelligence platform that maintains rate competitiveness, save time by reducing manual tasks.”,\n\n  “image”: “https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/React-to-Competitive-Prices-in-Real-Time-with-RG.jpg”,\n\n  “author”: {\n\n    “@type”: “Person”,\n\n    “name”: “Sandeep Singh – Senior Vice President, Product Management”\n\n  },\n\n  “publisher”: {\n\n    “@type”: “Organization”,\n\n    “name”: “RateGain”,\n\n    “logo”: {\n\n      “@type”: “ImageObject”,\n\n      “url”: “https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-rg-logo-1-180×180.png”\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  “datePublished”: “2020-06-15”,\n\n  “dateModified”: “2020-07-15”\n\n}",https://rategain.com/blog/react-to-competitive-prices-in-real-time-with-rategains-optima-marketdrone/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/React-to-Competitive-Prices-in-Real-Time-with-RG.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/React-to-Competitive-Prices-in-Real-Time-with-RG.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sandeep-singh.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,MarketDRONE,Optima,Rate intelligence,,,,,0
6563282ea3f6fc78b8eba228,702145599,Watch Your Language! Content in the New Hospitality Landscape,"June 2, 2020","There was a time when “travel accommodation” and “hotel” were virtually interchangeable. Sure, there were vacation properties, but at a smaller scale and not readily available on the major travel booking platforms. With the rise of Airbnb and other alternative accommodation platforms, this is no longer true. There is now a myriad of options available to travelers wishing to explore the world.A more appropriate term for what these new platforms offer is “alternative accommodation” rather than “vacation rental”. In the U.S. top destination cities of Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle there were 51 Airbnb properties listed in its first year of operation. By 2017, that number had was well over 50,000 and there are currently 666,000 property listings in United States by December 2019. [1]\nWhen you look closer at the accommodations offered, there is often an entire house, an apartment, or someone renting a spare bedroom. Consider for a moment the difference in experience for the following accommodations: studio apartment, houseboat, cottage, shared room, yurt, guest suite, and camp space. If you’re traveling with children, knowing that you’ll be staying on a boat may be critical, and a yurt may not be the best option for those with an aversion to bugs. But likewise, finding yourself in a motel room off the interstate on your hiking trip might just ruin that trip. Different accommodations provide different experience and caters to different audience. As such, your language should match the experience that you want to deliver.Table of ContentsContent is King…again!Travel, regardless of the purpose, is often a large investment of time, money, and energy for the traveler. Arming the traveler with accurate, relevant, and digestible information is key to ensuring a positive experience that meets the traveler’s expectation. I would also argue that in its simplest form, the formula for a good review is that expectations are equal to experience. Most of us in the travel industry know the importance of reviews and their impact on business and revenue.A Walker study found that by the year 2020, customer experience would overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator. Customers are willing to pay a price premium of up to 13% (and as high as 18%) for luxury and indulgence services, simply by receiving a great customer experience. The Harvard Review claims that customers who had great experiences in the past with a company will spend 140% more compared to people who had poor experiences. Therefore, clearly there is a correlation between the quality of the experience and revenue, which holds true in the hospitality industry. A study from Cornell School of administration shows that 1% increase in hotel’s reputation score increases ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR by 0.89%, 0.54% and 1.42% respectively.<img width=""800"" height=""450"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hospitality-net-infographic.jpg"" alt=""Hospitality Net"" />Hence, for a branded or independent hotel, communicating and setting expectations via content with a prospective guest on its own website is not hard, as the brand or property has complete control. But as soon as third-party distribution becomes a factor, control can be hard to maintain. Consider that we have only so far talked about one descriptive content label; accommodation type. When you considered the full breadth of descriptions to update and manage, you can quickly feel like it’s a daunting challenge and a never-ending battle to maintain accuracy.To make matters worse, the rapid changes in the distribution landscape complicates the management of accommodation content exponentially. Consider new entrants, acquisitions and changes in distribution technology—all impact content. That’s all before we consider making that content available in languages of desired source markets.Taking on the KingSo how do you manage expectation setting across the entire distribution ecosystem? The first step is of course an enticing, yet accurate description of your property and rooms. Being knowledge about industry terms for rooms, amenities and services helps as those are terms travelers are familiar with and can more easily understand what your property has to offer. Again, it helps with expectation setting. Make sure you offer as much information as possible as 78% of online consumers say they find product information important to their buying decision.Second, you need to transfer all this information into a database that is specifically built for hospitality content to be accurately distributed to any platform. The taxonomy needs to be built with hospitality accommodation and distribution in mind. This is often where some hospitality professionals stumble. At times, they fail to anticipate the downstream implications and hence the importance of a robust content management system that is intended for the complexities of hospitality distribution. It’s also where I recommend seeking some help. Managing property information and images is extremely time consuming. Especially so in an industry seeing constant change. With the emergence of personalization and attribute based pricing – even more granular content is added to the mix. In the Amazon era, consumers expect to get served up relevant content or offerings based on what they’re looking for. Poorly managed content makes this impossible.We have standardsOur industry is in need of standards to address the new diversity of accommodation providers. Most importantly for travel consumers to make informed choices. DHISCO has been anticipating this lodging convergence recognizing the importance of structure and standards, foreseeing the personalization revolution. We knew that there was only one way to bring some order to an industry that still used extranet and spreadsheet content distribution. We knew it was only a matter of time until the scale tipped toward alternative lodging. If we could manage the largest inventory of hospitality product information and imagery in the industry, both traditional and non-traditional, we would gain wisdom from the compilation, breadth, and depth of content.That gain was the closest thing to an industry standard for diverse lodging content that we have seen. And that has proven to be extremely valuable to hospitality providers as well as travel sellers such as OTAs, GDSs, and TMCs. Up until recently we had been extremely confident in a bet on content that was made years ago. But as alternative accommodations came on the scene, we realized that this content would have to sit on the same proverbial shelf as traditional hospitality content, contrasted and compared during the shopping process. We knew this would be the ultimate test to our structure, to our speed, and our ability to merge alternative accommodation information onto platforms built for traditional accommodation. That test now has a name.Monaker is the monikerMonaker [2] approached RateGain with the task of loading and managing their vacation rental inventory and increasing distribution through RateGain/DHISCO partners. We knew this would be the biggest challenge our content management system and DHISCO Switch had seen to date. The results? In three days, we loaded 100,000+ properties and over a million images. But we weren’t done. We then replicated each property and loaded it in four languages — totally error free.“DHISCO Content is an offering which is as unique as your guest. It provides a powerful content database with automatic update capabilities, an end-to-end descriptive, multi-lingual and digitalized product line, with flexible APIs that offer options for content via push or pull models. With DHISCO content, within just a couple of months, Monaker Group has already on boarded an initial 100,000+ of their approximately 3 million properties with images and content in 4 different languages namely Spanish, French, German and Italian apart from English.” Says Tim Sikora, Chief Operations and Chief Information Officer at Monaker Group.While I couldn’t be prouder of our team, the systems and infrastructure we have built, we are ready for the next challenge.

6563282fa3f6fc78b8eba22a,-1724406737,Keeping Lights on During the Current COVID Crisis!,"May 5, 2020","Resilience is the watchword during a sharp downturn. Companies that skillfully navigate these choppy waters will have one feature in common: they will have prepared today to build resilience tomorrow, no matter which way the economic winds blow. And sometimes, those winds blow more fiercely than others.During the Great Recession in 2008, hotels worldwide suffered double-digit drops in occupancy, RevPAR, and profit. In many cases, the drop happened in mere months, leaving hoteliers in a cut-throat pricing war. It was a horrible situation that left an indelible impression among hoteliers.It appears that we are the cusp of another recession. It’s time to get resilient. Here are six tips on what you need to do to keep the lights on over the upcoming weeks and months, no matter how vicious and lengthy it turns out to be.Table of Contents#1: Get Your Rates RightIn times of economic downturns, quite suddenly, the same number of hotels are competing for a shrinking market. Its survival mode with a singular focus: keeping the lights on with minimal long-term damage to the brand. And so, it’s most important to get your rates right.You have to be able to compete with your compset. You need to know what’s happening in the market and react in near real-time with regular rate updates. The premium for attracting and booking for the guest is at an all-time high. Customers are being pelted with discounts and offers from all over the place, so you don’t want to be turning away business because your rates are out of line. Overall, second quarter is going to be tough in most markets but recovery is on the horizon by third quarter, if the recovery in China and South Korea are any indication.<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Get-your-rates-right.png"" alt=""Get your rates right"" />Only once your rates are competitive can you go on to any of the other steps here. Even the slightest pricing mistake is magnified in a recession, so your rates must be perfectly precise!Pro tip: Don’t panic and lower your rates during these early days of the downturn. Downturns don’t last forever, and it can be hard to restore your rates once conditions improve. Let the data do the talking and make pricing decisions intentionally. #2: Know Your Guests WellWhen you think about competing, you can compete on price. That’s a given but you also need to be guest centric in your approach.A key component of getting your rates right is knowing your guests. The last thing you want to do is to follow your comp set off a discounting cliff, and unnecessarily drop your prices. Remember that everyone can compete on price without much effort. But you should compete on value, services and amenities — especially during a recession. Each hotel has its own guest mix and those that have a detailed understanding of that mix can pinpoint the right rate strategy for each channel, segment, and geography.The more you know about your guests the better you can target them. With sufficient guest data to micro-segment your audience, you can personalize offers and stimulate demand with targeted deals. The result is an intelligent and focused discounting strategy oriented around geography, segment, length-of-stay, and other parameters.Also, given the global nature of hospitality, you must be attuned to the status of the local economies that drive significant chunks of your business. Downturns can flare up anywhere, and as we know now, anytime! You must be hyper-vigilant and know your guest so you can foresee any local economic headwinds that might dampen demand from popular outbound markets.Pro tip: Encourage your staff to be guest whisperers. Insights derived from direct experience help build accurate guest profiles. Also, don’t hesitate to ask! Many guests are willing to share, especially if it benefits their own experience.#3: Choose Your Channels CarefullyA deeper understanding of your guests allows you to identify new sources of demand.\n\nOften, you’ll find unexpected sources of demand from regional or other domestic markets in slightly different cycles than yours.You can also look at what you know about your best guests — who they are, where they come from, what types of trips they do — and then look for overlaps between those characteristics and new distribution channels. The goal is to look far and wide for ways to get your hotel in front of the best guests. In a recession, you need to be doubly sure that you are investing your distribution dollars in channels that can reliably bring you profitable revenue.There are a few ways to identify this demand. One is to simply do your research; ask colleagues, read trade publications, and search the Internet. Another is to ask account managers at your OTAs for their input into the latest demand trends. And if you have a channel manager, those account reps are excellent resources for pointing you to the latest channels in specific markets. Here is an nice article on selecting 5 ways to choose the best channels for your hotel.The final option is to use technology, such as Smart Distribution, to help you find new, profitable sources of demand. The tool analyzes the channel mix of hotels in your compset to identify any gaps in your own distribution. By looking at how other hotels successfully capture demand, it recommends new distribution paths for your hotel’s inventory.Pro tip: Monitor your cost of distribution. In a recession, every cost must be carefully controlled. You must prioritize lower-cost channels since they’ll bring you more profitable revenue. A good habit to have, regardless of economic conditions!#4: Get Creative with Packages and PromotionsIn a recession, consumers aren’t just looking for the lowest prices — they are looking for value. You have to get creative! It’s all about how to use your fixed costs (amenities like valet, F&B, and spa) to your advantage. Build packages that appeal to your core demographics and give your property an advantage when the competition heats up.Start by putting together creative vacation packages that appeal to your core guest demographics. In a recession, where travelers have lower budgets for airfare or are eliminating vacations altogether, create a “simple splurge” staycation package that pampers guests without breaking the bank and target it to drive markets. These are going to be easier targets than faraway guests facing steep airfares or when flying as a whole has been reduced dramatically.Two other strategies to build creative packages and promotions:Pro tip: Past guests are especially valuable as they already have a relationship with your brand. Engage them with exclusive incentives, such as F&B credits, double points or “stay 3 nights, pay for 2.” Experiment early and often and double down on what works! #5: Analyze Your Data More OftenThe final step is to analyze your data more often during the downturn. Conditions change quickly and unexpectedly. Those who identify opportunities in different geographies, channels and guest segments will gobble them up first, leaving everyone else fighting for scraps.Your data will help you zoom in on your segment sweet spots. Which guest segments seem to be resilient in the face of the headwinds? What are the characteristics of are there any defining characteristics of your best customers?In addition to your internal systems, another helpful source of data is your OTA account manager. With deep visibility into global points-of-sale, they should be able to help you identify promising opportunities, such as geographies or segments ideally suited to your hotel, as well as potential opaque deals that help hit your break-even revenue number without sacrificing price position or brand perception.Pro tip: Challenging economic conditions should be treated as crises. Create a “War Room” and hold frequent meetings that bring sales, marketing, revenue, and operations together. Put the data front-and-center and foster a collaborative mindset that unites everyone in the fight for survival. # 6 Don’t Lose Sight of Your Tech StackWhen there’s a recession raging, “we’ll get to it next quarter” won’t fly; it will be too late and those hotels who have the right technology in place will leapfrog the underprepared. With the right tools in your toolbox, you can master the strategies we covered here. Unfortunately, hospitality technology investment lags other industries, leading to less-than-resilient hotels with glaring productivity and profitability gaps.And — here’s something that’s especially scary — hotels that get left behind may be at a permanent disadvantage after the next recession. Hospitality technology was in a very different place in 2008; we’ve gone leaps and bounds beyond where we were then. Those hotels with complete tech stacks will likely capture market share, develop stronger relationships with guests, and develop permanent advantages.A few tools that make up a resilient tech stack include:Instead of completely ignoring any technology investment decision during these times, scope out the technologies you want to invest in to drive stronger bonds with past guests. Decide on what you need to invest in for your tech stack today and avoid those regrets tomorrow when the market recovers. Your hotel will be positioned to not just survive but thrive, no matter what happens!By keeping the six tips highlighted top of mind along with some preparation, patience, and fortitude, you may find that you’ve not just survived but also thrived! And, of course, these steps will embed resilience in your operation to carry you through the long haul.About the AuthorDave Kolankarai\n\nSenior Vice President Account Management\n\nRateGainDave is an accomplished distribution executive with 20+ years of experience in the travel & hospitality industry.

65632830a3f6fc78b8eba22c,339437520,"Hoteliers, Spot New Markets to Create New Revenues in a Post-COVID 19 World","April 23, 2020","The last few months have brought an unprecedented spate of challenges for the hotels and hospitality sector. As the COVID-19 outbreak impacted 100+ countries around the world, all non-essential travel came to a halt. Exclusive research by RateGain revealed valuable insights into how COVID-19 influenced demand, supply, and distribution.Room revenue trend is poised to witness a steep decline, reducing by 16% month-on-month starting January-February 2020. Across the next 12 months, our analysis suggests that the decline will continue at a 9% pace for any data in the 12 months. The research is based on our latest bookings data in 90+ countries, across more than 50 properties registered between January 1 and February 29 of this year.Even more worrying is probably the number of cancellations – volumes have spiked by 53% year over year. This is in line with the predictions made by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which stated that airline travels and airlines could see losses to the tune of $113 billion in 2020, owing to the COVID-19 outbreak.In this situation, it is vital for hoteliers to not panic and rely on accurate data along with a thorough plan for determining the way forward. Frequently, the most common response is to reduce prices in a bid to drive up demand. Unfortunately, this isn’t the right answer, as a blanket-curb on all non-essential travel will hold back demand for even the most value-focused room offering.In fact, price reduction as a strategy could adversely impact a hotel’s brand reputation, creating needless discrepancies in the minds of travelers.Instead, hotel chains should look at leveraging data and advanced analytics engines to address some of their most pressing challenges in the wake of COVID-19.Table of Contents5 Key Challenges That Could Hinder Business Continuity and ExpansionAt RateGain, we are focused on helping hotel chains and hospitality providers regain their market footing and profitability streams by planning for a #BetterTomorrow.To achieve this, hoteliers must reimagine their distribution channels with a keen focus on ROI. Tried-and-tested approaches that worked in the past may not find the same response in a post-COVID-19 industry landscape. Conversely, a trial and error approach isn’t something that most hotel chains can afford, as competitors try to sway customer loyalty and gain a competitive advantage.The following challenges require immediate attention if hoteliers are to maintain business continuity:1. Discovering new demand The global impact of COVID-19 has been extremely heterogeneous. There is no one-size-fits-all model that one can apply to unlock new opportunities and possible demand sources. Hoteliers and revenue managers need comprehensive data, updated in real-time, to inform their fresh go-to-market strategies once the restraints put in place in response to COVID-19 are lifted.Unfortunately, traditional distribution technology does not make room for advanced market insights on these lines. There is a risk of missing popular channels, and inaccurate competitor analysis at a time when every property will try innovative, outside the box pricing tactics.2. Forging contracts with new channels Once global demand for travel starts to pick up, hotels have to be more ubiquitous in their marketing footprint than ever before. Already, mobile bookings dominate the landscape, with over 50% of bookings taking place on mobile channels. Between 2018 and 2025, travel booking payments through mobile was expected to cross $1.7 billion, and that is in the APAC alone.As business and leisure travel begins to catch up in a post-COVID-19 context, we expect travelers to spend more time on research, spread across multiple devices and channels. However, existing distribution technologies cause new channel contracts to become a lengthy process. It takes approximately 30-45 days to onboard a new channel; in the meantime, prospective customers could be looking elsewhere for research and bookings.3. Setting up content for new demand This is linked to the previous challenge. Let’s say that a hotel has successfully tied up with a channel after a month of negotiations, effort, and protocol. Now, the hotel staff must spend additional time on setting up the content, manually addressing each extranet. There is a lot of effort duplication, not to mention lost time.An active channel without the requisite information and content in place is likely to put off travelers, who are eager to experience the best accommodations after an extended period of lockdown. Despite the demand being strong in a post-COVID-19 scenario, hoteliers who do not proactively plan for a #BetterTomorrow with expedited content setup might lose out.4. Mapping channels and setting up a channel managerOnce again, this is a highly labor-intensive process. It is done manually for each hotel by the channel management staff, who spend a few weeks on mapping different channels and configuring the manager. Ineffective mapping could lead to incorrect room pricing, bringing down per room revenues – on the other hand, a careful setup only extends a hotel’s go-to-market when recovering from the COVID-19 impact.Fortunately, this challenge is easy to address, by leveraging an AI-based automated mapping recommendations engine. For instance, RateGain’s auto-mapping recommender saves 80% of the manual mapping timelines.5. Pushing rates and inventory This critical part of hotel distribution should always be informed by data. And this need is intensified by disaster events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.Robust rate intelligence and inventory management will remove any rate disparity between channels, ensuring that a hotel’s brand reputation does not take a hit. As customers come out of a protracted curb on travel, the hotel chains that first and most effectively make a positive impression will stand to win customer loyalty for good. Monitoring rate parity and resolving parity issues promptly is integral to this.How RateGain Can Help to Prepare (and Not Panic) Scenarios like COVID-19 are a good opportunity to set one’s eyes on new markets and fresh revenue generation opportunities. Rather than bringing down rates in a bid to attract customers, hoteliers can diversify their market footprint, making in-roads into fresh channels, distribution networks, and market regions. But to get this right, they need complete and consistently updated insights into travel demand, regional trends, and competitor movements.At RateGain, we firmly believe that the appropriate datasets could usher in a #BetterTomorrow, by enabling the following:Typically, it takes revenue managers anywhere between 2-4 months to go through the 5-step value chain we listed, overcoming its numerous challenges. From finding new channels and forming contracts to loading, mapping, and validating content and the final Go Live, hoteliers need to spend enormous time and effort to penetrate new markets — something they simply cannot afford in the post COVID-19 world. RateGain’s composite solutions shrink this by more than 50%, completing the entire process in 30-45 days.Using our Smart Distribution technology, it is possible to unlock exceptional ROI, even as hoteliers try to offset any losses incurred due to the pandemic.RateGain’s Smart Distribution capabilities are keenly focused on uncovering new revenue opportunities for hoteliers, powered by our massive database of 240 billion rate plan points. This, combined with our sophisticated analytical models, surfaces hidden insights on key action points. Hoteliers could obtain visibility into potential revenue loss, high-demand distribution channels, and rate intelligence sourced from the world’s leading chains/brands to plan the most effective next-best course of action. This makes RateGain one of the most compelling solutions available in the market today.As you can see, cutting-edge technologies make it possible for hoteliers to outline a strong business continuity and disaster recovery roadmap, even in the face of crisis situations like the COVID-19. For instance, our Smart Distribution solution can help hotels quickly regain their market footing by reinforcing their presence on lucrative channels, which were overlooked in the past.Keep Calm and Carry On: Strengthening Business Continuity for a #BetterTomorrow There is no denying the pandemic’s global impact on the overall travel, transport & hospitality value chain. Billions of prospective customers are now being turned away from travel plans, prioritizing citizen safety and the industry’s overall health and safety. However, it is important to prepare for a #BetterTomorrow, putting in place the requisite measures that allow hotels to gain from the inevitable steadying (or even rise) of market demand, once this period approaches a close.Already, experts believe that travel patterns will see surprising changes in response to COVID-19. In the UK, for example, a localized spike in demand for staycations could offset air travel during the holiday period.In China, where the country is experiencing early signs of recovery, hotel bookings increased by 40% on March 1, compared to the previous week. Bookings for domestic flights increased by a massive 230% from the record low registered in February. Industry leaders need accurate updates and actionable information on these trends if they are to gain from a #BetterTomorrow – not stay complacent amidst the market slump brought on by COVID-19.At RateGain, we view the combination of a technology-driven business continuity plan and a pragmatic recovery strategy as central to success in the next few months. The key is to keep an eye on evolving trends, take data-driven (and not panic-ridden) decisions, and build a foundation that allows hotel chains to tap into opportunities without missing a beat.To know more, please contact us at marketing@rategain.com.About the Author Philip Liu\n\nVice President\n\nRateGainPhilip has been driving commercial and operation results through integrated technology and re-engeneering people and process with 25+ years hospitality and travel experiences.

65632834a3f6fc78b8eba230,-2136019910,We Are Bracing Ourselves: Are You?,"March 20, 2020","The sudden outbreak of the novel COVID-19, which has been recently declared as a ‘pandemic’ by the WHO, has compelled many organizations to question and rethink on their readiness and agility to combat such global crisis. During this tough time, the most important aspects for companies to address are the well-being of their employees while maintaining business continuity.The current crisis has inadvertently started off a marathon exercise in concepts like ‘Work from Home (WFH)’, remote logins, and virtual meetings—both with internal and external clients. Many organizations from startups to large established conglomerates across sectors have announced WFH for their employees.While some organizations may have been partly using WFH as an effective employee engagement tool before the crisis, all organizations are now bound to use WFH to ensure business continuity.Some organizations have invested timely in the right kind of technologies, systems, and processes to enable their employees to work from anywhere—independent of their physical presence in office. At the same time, for most organizations, there are mindset and infrastructure related challenges. For instance, many organizations think that WFH lowers employee productivity. More than anything else, the problem is the ‘mindset’.To make this work, organizations need to address some difficult questions such as ‘what are the vulnerabilities that their teams are exposed to’, ‘which ones can create hindrance on their way to expand working just beyond desk jobs’ among others. It is important, therefore, to identify which functional role(s) will have a major role to play, to make remote working an ease during a crisis.Additionally, to make WFH an effective way of working, organizations should take help from technology. The first and foremost is the basic infrastructure such as Internet connectivity and hardware (internet dongles, laptops among others). There are organizations where employees engaged in key operational roles such as Finance, Legal, Compliance, Sales still work on office provided infrastructure like desktops and Internet connectivity. Forced remote working has exposed the vulnerabilities of many organizations wherein their employees do not have these basic infrastructures to effectively work from remote locations.At RateGain, we already have a ‘WFH’ policy for our employees. At the onset of the current crisis, it was ensured that all employees had basic infrastructure in place for carrying out their work duties at home effectively. Laptops were arranged for the employees who were working on a desktop to ensure business continuity while working from home.Besides, data security is a serious concern for every organization contemplating a WFH policy. Organizations need to use the best of technologies to keep their highly confidential data and information secured. Most often, critical functions are performed on systems, which work on office Intranets only and as such require organizations to provide special technology tools like VPNs, Citrix to their employees for them to be able to access their work remotely. While these tools are readily available in the market, the key question is how the organizations ensure data security and confidentiality.Finally, customer interactions, which have generally been face-to-face, have been forced to move to the virtual world through tools such as Webex, Zoom, and Google Hangouts among others. This requires more of a mindset change from an organization and a client relationship perspective. For instance, at RateGain all our client interactions have now been moved online without any compromises on delivery of work and client relationship. All internal and external client meetings have since been done virtually at RateGain.Today if the organizations have to survive a crisis like COVID–19, they need to change their core way of how they have been operating so far. The leadership needs to consider a broader & long-term perspective that can help companies to emerge stronger and with flying colors during such hard times. For this they need to consider having a team which is allocated out and out for experimenting and doing crisis management as well as plan business continuity processes.For instance, at RateGain, while initially we had a responsive approach towards the whole chaos made by COVID–19, but it did not take us much long to realize that we as an organization needs to address and thrive through these times effectively. We immediately made a crisis-management team whose major task is to ensure and enable the business continuity while ensuring the safety and health of all the employees.To ensure ‘business as usual’ organizations today need to work on ‘business unusual’ until it becomes their DNA. At RateGain, there has been continuous communication from the Leadership and HR Function to ensure that the morale of the employees remain high and relevant information with respect to the crisis is disseminated to employees timely.Organizations need to look within themselves and find an answer to the question today: Have we braced ourselves?About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px; border: 2px solid #f59c00; border-radius: 50%; margin-right:20px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sahil.jpg"" alt="""" width=""97"" height=""76"" />Sahil Sharma<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""vertical-align: top;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nVP & Global Head- Human Capital\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/have-we-braced-ourselves/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sahil.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,Blog,,,COVID 19,,,,,,,0
65632835a3f6fc78b8eba232,529844636,How to Capture Rate Integrity Issues in the Most Simplified Way,"March 11, 2020","Rate disparity does not only dent your profits but also harms your hotel brand’s reputation. Maintaining rate parity across all distribution channels is, therefore, critical to your hotel chain.The complex task of achieving rate parity is all about maintaining ‘rate integrity’ by avoiding the temptation of offering dramatic discounts and, at the same time, having no justification for other guests who bought the same room for a much higher price.In the last six months, we have spoken to over 100 hospitality leaders to understand their parity-related concerns. Interestingly, their ask is simple: ‘Show me the details of all rate integrity issues in the most simplified and actionable way possible.’Based on their requirements and our research, we have re-designed our AI-driven rate integrity platform Parity+, to show all the violations upfront and in real-time; it also allows the user to take an appropriate action immediately.Catering to the simple ask of the hospitality leaders has been a difficult task for us; we took it as a challenge. Once we understood the key problem areas and asks, we created personas, customer journey maps, information architecture and new design language. We also did ‘need versus feature’ analysis to ensure we provide data sets, which are useful for hotel revenue managers; we removed the elements, which were not important.In all, hospitality leaders have been at the center of this re-design work. We have simplified the complex landscape of rate integrity issues.How Did We Achieve Simplicity: The new Parity+ dashboard, which has been completely re-imaged now uses data cards, and lets the users play with the data as well. We show the provisional revenue loss when a distribution channel undercuts you. Here is a look at how we achieved the most simplified way of handling the complex rate integrity issues.<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-4994"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Capture-Rate-Integrity-Issues-in-the-Most-Simplified-Way-5.png"" alt="""" width=""100%"" />We have very passionately created this new experience; hope you enjoy it too.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaurav-Lal.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Gaurav Lal<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""vertical-align: top;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nSenior Vice President – Product Design\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/how-to-capture-rate-integrity-issues-in-the-most-simplified-way/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Capture-Rate-Integrity-Issues-in-the-Most-Simplified-Way-copy-1024x536-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Capture-Rate-Integrity-Issues-in-the-Most-Simplified-Way-copy-1024x536-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Capture-Rate-Integrity-Issues-in-the-Most-Simplified-Way-5.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaurav-Lal.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Blog,,,Product Design,User experience,,,,,,0
65632836a3f6fc78b8eba234,2006934809,Top 3 Rate Disparity Cases Acceptable to a Revenue Manager,"March 4, 2020","Hotel revenue managers today face myriad of challenges while devising a holistic pricing strategy, driving top-line growth, and plugging revenue leakage. Maximizing revenue has become increasingly difficult due to the proliferation of multiple distribution channels including brand sites, Online Travel Agents (OTAs), and new-age channels such as mobile apps. Revenue managers need to constantly track prices across channels to ensure they are ahead of the competition, and sales are not being hurt due to the existing pricing strategy.Once the pricing strategy is in place, the other critical function performed by the revenue manager is that of identifying and fixing rate parity violations. The idea is to ensure no OTA is undercutting your price, causing revenue leakage, and harming your brand reputation. However, there are scenarios where revenue managers would overlook parity violation alerts due to revenue considerations, channel preference, or concerns around deep discounting by OTAs. Here are three common scenarios where revenue managers take that call.Scenario 1: Parity Violation on Brand Website There are times a revenue manager will receive an alert about a parity violation on the brand’s own website, implying that the price on the website is lower than what is being offered across OTA sites and other channels. Considering the cost of distribution is the lowest for direct channels of sales, the revenue manager may choose to not fix the violation. The lower price is still more profitable as the OTA’s margins do not have to be considered. Such a disparity may actually drive sales via the brand’s own website, resulting in better brand engagement and retargeting opportunities in the future. Moreover, it gives the brand the much valuable data about customer preferences based on how they navigate the website and select the rooms.Scenario 2: Parity Violation on Preferred OTA’s Website Large hotel chains and hospitality conglomerates tend to have one or more OTAs that drive maximum sales for their properties. In such a situation, where the hotel’s revenue stream is closely tied with the OTA’s performance, revenue managers disregard parity violations by the OTA in question. For instance, one of the largest hotel networks in the world by number of rooms keeps its prices the lowest on two leading OTA websites in Indonesia. This is done so the hotel continues to appear on the first two pages of the search results on the website as it has been proven that 70% hotel bookings are made on those pages.Scenario 3: Parity Violation with Respect to Add-ons Going back to the point of promoting direct channels of sales, revenue managers may maintain rate parity on their own website while offering extra add-ons not available on other OTA websites at the same price. By doing so, the hotel attracts new and existing customers to their own website to complete the booking process. Leading new-age channels that help customers compare prices across platforms—including the brand site and OTA sites—have had a positive impact on sales when such a strategy is implemented. In the absence of those platforms, such parity control measures would have little or no effect on buying behaviour, unless the customer religiously checks multiple OTA websites and the brand sites to make an informed decision.Conclusion While rate parity control is an essential tool in a hotel revenue manager’s arsenal, there are times when they must rely on their judgement based on the market situation and past experience to make pricing decisions. In the case, decisions to act on a parity violation alerts.Rate parity control can be a tremendously effort intensive exercise, often prone to errors. However, there are ways in which future-ready, rate integrity platforms such as PARITY+ are enabling revenue managers to monitor rates across channels and identify violations in real-time. With end-to-end rate integrity management using data analytics to track travel sellers’ flows, hoteliers can ensure transparency across sales and distribution channels, including both accredited and unaccredited OTAs.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px; border: 2px solid #f59c00; border-radius: 50%; margin-right: 20px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KD-web.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Kunwardeep Singh<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""vertical-align: top;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nAssociate Vice President- Customer Success\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/top-3-rate-disparity-cases-acceptable-to-a-revenue-manager/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accpteable.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accpteable.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KD-web.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,Blog,,,Product Design,User experience,,,,,,0
65632837a3f6fc78b8eba236,1715533149,Rate Integrity: A Brand New Way of Increasing Direct Bookings,"February 27, 2020","Maintaining rate parity is a consistent challenge for hotel revenue managers. In today’s hyper-digital travel industry, search engines, OTAs, and other digital platforms all promise a ‘lowest price guarantee,’ but few live up to the guest’s expectations.Inevitably, a guest finding a wide disparity in accommodation rates across channels loses ‘trust’ in the hotel and is less likely to stay loyal in the long-term. It’s no wonders that travelers are also confused about where to find the best deals. They end up using search engines and OTAs, decreasing the number of direct bookings on the hotel sites. In all, the guest loses trust and the hotel loses profits and brand reputation. There’s so much at stake.Hence, managing parity across channels is not a task; it’s a bigger responsibility. Let me elaborate on my thoughts in the subsequent words.Table of ContentsHere’s What Most of us Know and UnderstandWhile rate parity is an accepted norm, maintaining it across platforms is complex. While acquisition of guests through OTAs is expensive for a hotel, OTAs offer indispensable services—helping them increase brand awareness, reach, form fills and bookings. Room prices are flexible but must always remain the same across all distribution channels, both direct and indirect. According to a survey of approximately 600 participants conducted by Phocuswire, approximately 50% of hotels are heavily reliant on bookings from OTAs, even if they violate rate parity agreements.Despite all measures, most hotels are out of parity on most days of a year. The disparity issues can arise due to various issues; it could be made deliberately or as a result of human or technical error. The result is the same; loss in direct bookings and thus revenues.The problem doesn’t end here. In some cases, the hotel is not even aware who the defaulter is. On top of that, only a quarter of the Phocuswire survey said, they took corrective action when rate disparity issues were detected.Here’s is What a Handful of us Practice Fixing revenue leakages is not just about maintaining parity. The driving principle is brand integrity while being able to change rates in-sync with market dynamics. Rate integrity aims for the perfect balance between consistency and flexibility.Now, while it may sound simple, the definition of ‘rate integrity’ isn’t so straight forward. It may differ from revenue manager to revenue manager. While some focus on fair pricing, others might want to provide the maximum value for price to their guests. Similarly, it can involve revenue managers rationalizing price discounts to demonstrate that the hotel isn’t changing rates without reason – rather, the hotel is working to ensure discounts are consistent across brand sites, OTAs, and other distribution channels.The Phocuswire study we mentioned above also highlighted the importance of rate integrity in today’s market: 85% of respondents scored the issue at an 8, 9, or 10 levels of severity; less than 4% rated it 5 or below. And 75% felt that they were “powerless” in address disparity and achieving rate integrity across platforms.Here’s What All of us Should Know to Increase Direct Booking & Brand Reputation Fixing revenue leakages is not just about maintaining parity. The driving principle is brand integrity while being able to change rates in-sync with market dynamics. Rate integrity aims for the perfect balance between consistency and flexibility.In a hotel revenue growth strategy, rate integrity and parity go hand in hand. While maintaining rate parity to ensure consistent pricing, a hotelier must practice rate integrity. It’s the best as well as the most difficult state to achieve. Therefore, it’s important for the next-gen revenue managers to take help from technology for:A user-friendly, next-gen rate integrity platform PARITY+ can really help revenue managers to put a halt on rate disparity, revenue decline, and negative brand reputation. A next-gen revenue manager can experience an average of 10-12% increase in bookings by solving parity issues through a platform that offers rate integrity.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sandeep-singh.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Sandeep Singh<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""vertical-align: top;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nSenior Vice President – Product Management\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/rate-integrity-a-brand-new-way-of-increasing-direct-bookings/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rate-Integrity-A-Brand-New-Way-of-Increasing-Direct-Bookings-.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rate-Integrity-A-Brand-New-Way-of-Increasing-Direct-Bookings-.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sandeep-singh.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,,,Product Design,User experience,,,,,,0
65632839a3f6fc78b8eba238,-2064266255,Why Choose Rate Intelligence Over Rate Shopping?,"February 19, 2020","The hotel industry is witnessing large-scale proliferation of Online Travel Aggregators (OTA) and high-price sensitivity. Hoteliers are, thus, spending innumerable hours on comparing competitive rates for making pricing decisions. For harnessing and optimizing new and existing revenue streams, hotel revenue managers need a comprehensive view into how the traveler perceives their brand and how their rates compare with those of their competitors. Creating a robust pricing model is even more crucial for hotels witnessing continuously shrinking margins. Dwindling profits can be attributed to high costs of labor, marketing, and distribution, and largely stagnant rates and revenue.The complexities in the entire revenue-management process are multiplied when you factor in-demand forecasting, systematic changes in the demand-supply equation, and Length of Stay (LOS) restrictions put in by competitors. Revenue managers need sufficient data and actionable insights to make the right pricing decisions and stay ahead of the competition.More than 70 percent of the bookings on OTA platforms being made for hotels listed on the first two pages of the search results. It, therefore, becomes critical that the pricing strategy is fine tuned to plug revenue leakage. And it doesn’t stop there. Hoteliers also need to be wary of variations in rates, promotions, and availability across various regional websites of the same OTA.Traditional rate shopping solutions have not been able to keep up with these emerging business requirements.Table of ContentsCommon Pitfalls of Legacy Rate Shopping ToolsHoteliers using traditional platforms for rate comparison and price optimization face many limitations with respect to relevance, sufficiency, and accuracy of rate information. To build better pricing models, it is essential that the rates shopped are up to date and detailed. Moreover, the price intelligence platform should be able to shop rates from a variety of sources. It also needs to map various rate/room combinations with the right keywords.Incumbent, outdated rate shoppers are not able to deliver the kind of functionalities and user experience that hotel revenue managers deserve to be more productive. Such tools may also worsen already dwindling profits if they rely too much on limited competitor information, recommending high discounts as the date of arrival approaches.To fill those gaps, future-ready rate intelligence platforms are being built to factor-in attributes such as brand reputation and market supply information to be truly useful for revenue managers.Unleashing Rate Intelligence for Sustainable Top Line Growth Next-generation rate intelligence platforms are changing the way hotels drive pricing decisions. Those platforms have been built to provide granular insights into price movements across the online universe. Plus, they deliver a seamless, intuitive user experience for revenue managers. They are enabling multiple views to slice and dice rates information and providing reputation data for the brand and its competitors on top OTAs and meta search sites.These rate intelligence platforms are delivering 360-degree visibility into the booker, the points of sale, and the competition. They are allowing the revenue manager to access a booker’s eye view of how their property is being viewed by their customer base. Moreover, hoteliers can now also account for local factors such as events, flight arrival information, and web shopping data to build a more holistic pricing model.Rate Intelligence vs. Rate Shopping<img decoding=""async"" class=""size-medium wp-image-4978 alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/table-infographic-1.png"" alt="""" width=""100%"" />Through advanced tagging engines, rate intelligence platforms are enabling users to perform complex comparisons between highly differentiated products. They also monitor real-time data to identify parity violations where an OTA or other website is undercutting the direct sales channel. In-built end-to-end rate integrity management using data analytics to track travel sellers’ flows is key to ensuring transparency across sales and distribution channels and must be a top priority while selecting a rate intelligence solution.At RateGain, we have worked closely with leaders in the hospitality space to understand their pertinent challenges and build a rate intelligence platform – OPTIMA. It processes billions of rate points every day through an auto-scalable cloud infrastructure. With 99 plus percent data sufficiency and accuracy, covering 1,100 plus brand sites, 100+ OTAs, 500+ tour operators, and ten meta sites, all majoe GDS companies, OPTIMA gets fresh rates every 60 seconds. That allows revenue managers to make data-centric decisions with confidence.OPTIMA gives users an opportunity to track CUG promotions and minimum LOS restrictions, and even change the comp-set in real-time to compare OTA positioning. Through auto-population of events and holidays, it helps hotels to anticipate high demand. Its market compression tracking features help focus on high/low demand check-in dates. The value created by OPTIMA is amplified by our leading-edge rate parity offering, Parity +, that tracks rate parity violations on accredited and unaccredited OTAs.With the new user experience and interface of OPTIMA, the users can make crucial decision more efficiently than ever.

6563283ca3f6fc78b8eba23a,933929082,Why a Rate Intelligence Experience Should Have the Best Art & Science Behind it,"February 5, 2020","Hospitality industry gives the utmost importance to their guest experience. However, the industry has often ignored the simplification of rate intelligence, which drives its revenue management and thereby it’s top line.In my recent interactions with revenue managers, I noticed that they have to often go through a tedious grind to analyze and process the best rates, in order to stay ahead of their aggressive competitors. They have to look at competition, OTAs, ratings, reviews, local events and holidays to design their pricing strategies and do forecasting. And to do all this, they have to work with multiple applications, tools, and spreadsheets.But, does it really have to be so complicated? The answer is an absolute ‘no’. While a large number of rate shopping products are available in the market, but very few pay attention to the art and science behind it.Table of ContentsThe Art & Science Behind Rate IntelligenceDesigning and ensuring a rich User Experience (UX) is a craft; it’s a combination of arts (colors, simplicity, and layout) and science (quick learnability, easy navigations, and responsiveness). Therefore, it is important that revenue managers are enabled with a rate intelligence platform that is not only efficient but also easy to use.We, at RateGain, have recently refreshed our rate intelligence platform OPTIMA, to make it more user-friendly than ever. To come up with the new user experience, we worked with over 100 revenue manager across continents to co-create a new rate intelligence experience that helps revenue managers access and consume data efficiently. In the past six months, we organized several customer workshops and spent 1,000s of hours to work on their suggestions.We followed the design-thinking methodology, to discover the problem areas by talking to several revenue managers across the globe. We mapped the findings on the board to drive patterns and feelings. We looked at personas, customer journey maps, information architecture to simplify the interface. Data visualization was very important in providing clear and actionable insights. The outcome went through several iterations before it eventually went live today.Here is a snapshot of what has changed in the new refreshing version of OPTIMA.Layout<img width=""300"" height=""169"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignright"" style=""margin-left: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/optima-screen-shot.png"" alt=""Colors"" />We redesigned the entire dashboard. More space and focus has been given to the calendar view, which now has been color coded to highlight the specific days where your rate is above or below your competition. This will enable the revenue managers to make faster decisions.Shallow Navigation On-demand reports, which were hidden deep in the navigation have been put upfront to reduce times spent by 15 minutes.Quick Learnability While a user in a hotel will get trained and will also learn the tool by hit and trial. However, we have provided coach marks, which helps them get started quickly and focus on their key tasks.In all, on the new interface, revenue managers can now look for ‘competition average rates’, ‘pace charts’, ‘events’, ‘holidays’, ‘visual indicator on how you are doing versus competition’, ‘on-demand reports’, ‘view data as calendar or graph or table’, and ‘filters, which help you to see what you want to see’. And, there’s more to it.I am really excited about the new version.

The expectations from distribution managers are not limited to just enabling this exchange but also toIn a nutshell, the new age distribution managers want to invest more of their time in building well thought through hotel distribution strategies for their product & much lesser time in mundane operational tasks.Table of ContentsDistribution Journey Problem<img width=""1150"" height=""550"" decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hotel-chains-infographic-1-1.png"" alt=""Distribution Journey Problem"" />At RateGain, we believe that the modern hospitality distribution landscape demands more agility, and data based insights to be able to generate maximum value and unlock new revenue creation opportunities. A distribution ecosystem can become a window into creation of new opportunities for both hotels and demand partners if they get a platform which makes it frictionless to recommend the match between the hotel & the channel basis mutual value & enable a seamless connection to start deriving this value quickly.

6563283ea3f6fc78b8eba23e,1519279764,Are You Leading A Future-Ready HR?,"January 29, 2020","A lot of employers feel confident about the growth of their business and high employee morale, but they often face two significant challenges; finding the right people and motivating them. These two challenges always keep HR departments across different industries busy. The HR department is slowly becoming less about administrative tasks and more about adding strategic value to the organisation.In a matter of years from now, technology is destined to disrupt the existing scenario. As most of the core functions of HR get automated, Professionals will be able to showcase their skills and become talent strategists and retention experts who build and nurture the culture of the organisation thereby impacting the lives positively. Nowadays, organisations are quite competitive to land top talent and retaining it. Building an “Employment brand” has become essential to attract the right kind of people to your Company. A recent #HarvardBusinessReview article reads that an average employee will change jobs no less than 12 times throughout their career. This not only puts pressure on HR to find talent but also to continuously engage, retain, and develop it. It is therefore vital that HR professionals adopt a holistic approach to the entire employee lifecycle from the early stages of attraction and onboarding through career development, training and learning.As most of the primary HR tasks transition into automation, HR professionals need to shift their focus on engaging and developing people. Rigid and Legacy HR systems which include manual processes will no longer inhibit HR from nurturing relationships and impacting lives of people. Retaining and developing the existing talent is as important as finding the top talent in today’s world. This dynamic is intensified by millennials who tend to job hop until they find the perfect fit for them. As leaders of HR, one must build the HR team, which is focused on investing in performance management and continuous learning to propagate a culture of learning and frequent performance check-in throughout the organisation.We live in a world of constraints. Unlike large organisations, such as Google, Apple among many more, HR professionals in the SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) may not be equipped enough to invest in AI/ML-enabled “big data” – Although, don’t be disappointed! As an HR in the SME, one can focus on “small data.” Small data is information which can instantly be interpreted and applied to consumption by an individual without extensive processing. It is informative, easily accessible, and provides critical insights that can drive business decisions. For instance, monitoring employee turnover enables one to identify significant trends, root causes, & then find the solution. Other small data illustrations include time taken to hire, cost per hire, acceptance rates, employee satisfaction, among many more. Moreover, one can also use a combination of both small data and big data while making decisions. Performance review This is one of the topics that attract not just the HR leaders but also the business stakeholders. In the last few years, the Employer-Employee agreement has gone through a lot of transformation. Gone are the days when the employees would stick with a single organisation from hire to retire. Job hopping is the new trend.In today’s world, if employees don’t get frequent opportunities to learn and grow and if they don’t get timely feedback, chances are they’ll hop much sooner. This new trend is forcing many employers to redesign the review process. As an employer, the need of the hour suggests moving towards more frequent and less formal feedback sessions and check-ins to achieve even more momentum.Invest in the right technologyAs an HR, how much time one spends answering the same questions to employees? How many hours does one spend on running payroll? On spreadsheets and paper filing? On benefits enrolment? Most people get into the field of HR to make an impact, but many get stuck in administration work instead. One reason for that is sticking to the traditional HR technology that was built to do one thing: Ensure compliance, it was mainly a legal reporting tool, built with the government in mind, and not the HR user but the good news is, all that is changing very fast.Today, the right HR technology partner can automate the administrative work that may be keeping HR work limited.As a conclusion, most HR teams in the next three years will be focused on 3 top priorities:In the next few years, HR, with their vast skill sets and unique perspective on business operations, is positioned to add more strategic value on critical issues ranging from recruiting and onboarding to capacity building. HR leaders should gear up for the challenge and become more strategic and should critically focus on people development as there’s never been a better time to make an impact!

65632840a3f6fc78b8eba240,-635313280,5 Ways to Ace Hospitality Marketing in 2020,"January 20, 2020","The hospitality marketing industry is a curious mix of practices that have proven effective for decades now, and emerging trends that are taking the world by storm. And then you have a highly diverse market demographic, with wildly varying needs across segments. The millennial tourist eager to explore international destinations has little to do with high net worth individuals traveling primarily for work. Inevitably, this makes the job of hospitality marketers extremely difficult!But if there’s something that’s common to virtually every demographic you look at, it would be the ubiquity of social media, and the demand for personalization. Leisure travelers are increasingly looking at platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, for inspiration. In the business segment, the search for accommodation and travel options frequently begins online. As a result, any hospitality brand – no matter who they are catering to – must actively work on their social presence.And if you’re still not convinced, recent reports confirm that digital touchpoints are integral to customer journeys in hospitality, opening up new opportunities for marketers to engage and inform.Table of ContentsInsightful Trends and What They Mean for Hospitality Marketers There’s more than anecdotal evidence that drives home the relevance of social media in hospitality marketing. Consider the following statistics:\n\n<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategain.com/emailer/images/infographic-img.jpg"" alt=""Insightful Trends and What They Mean for Hospitality Marketers"" width=""645"" height=""592"" />Clearly, brands need to up their hospitality marketing game in order to connect with the new-age traveler. Let’s look at four best practices in this regard.Lessons in Hospitality Marketing for the Social Media Era Today, there’s a variety of platforms and digital touchpoints that marketers can use to connect with travelers. Expectedly, social media heads the pack, given its high ROI quality and “always-on” presence. It’s estimated that 3.5 billion people regularly use social media to communicate with friends, family, and their favorite brands. This opens up a massive prospective audience, many of whom are interested in international travel, breaking geographical barriers.A Final Takeaway for Hospitality Marketers Remember, hospitality marketing is all about increasing a brand’s reach on the one hand and maximizing each guest’s lifetime value on the other. Step 1 and 4 are geared for the former, helping to acquire fresh customers in a rapidly evolving market. Step 2 and 3 are for strengthening relationships with existing customers, boosting their lifetime value. And hotels could even leverage cutting-edge technologies such as the Guest Experience Cloud Platform to turn customer delight into sustained value. This, we believe, will be critical as customers ask for more, and hospitality service providers are compelled to deliver.This article was originally published in Phocuswire : https://www.phocuswire.com/Five-ways-ace-hospitality-marketing-2020About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/apurva.png"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />Apurva Chamaria<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nChief Revenue Officer\n\nRateGain Apurva Chamaria is the Chief Revenue Officer of RateGain, one of world’s leading SaaS company’s serving over 20,000+ customers in the travel and hospitality industry across 100+ Countries.

65632841a3f6fc78b8eba242,598804187,Why UX is Instrumental for Revenue Management,"January 14, 2020","Data analytics in the hospitality sector has always held incredible promise. With rapid advancements in business intelligence and UI design, I was eager to take the latest innovations to the world’s leading (and most disruptive) hospitality brands. This would help them deliver exceptional experiences to travelers across the globe, in turn translating into a measurable uptick in revenues.It’s only been about three months that I have been part of the RateGain team, spearheading a variety of product initiatives in the travel & hospitality domain. With a background in Design Thinking, I saw this as the perfect opportunity for creating a UI that meets the needs of today’s hospitality analytics customer.But what does this customer look like?To answer this question, I deployed design thinking principles, across multiple service design workshops that would allow RateGain to delve deeper into the customer mindset. This revealed three unique personas and helped arrive at an effective design strategy for our platforms.Table of ContentsWho are we making these changes for? While this is a broad classification, creating customer personas can be useful when aligning specific UI features to everyday business needs. Here’s what we learned:Following The Holy Grail of ContextTravel & Hospitality is a highly customised, with several micro-decisions determining business success. This means that the interface used to access and interpret data is mission-critical, influencing the insights gained and the decisions followed. RateGain interviewed over a hundred customers across our design thinking sessions to analyze a typical day in the life of a revenue manager for a hospitality brand. This revealed the essential anatomy of our customers’ decision-making process and why they choose to do what they do.As analytics providers, it is our responsibility to empower analytics customers with a comprehensive set of information to drive decision accuracy. That’s why we followed a storytelling to get to the bottom of our customer’s unique context, goals, and pain points.Here’s a sample storyline that could be followed during these interviews:“When my GM calls me, it is usually an intense moment; I have to find what he needs quickly. I have to keep myself always updated, which sometimes is not possible. Hence I have to rely on . When the system becomes slow, or I have to struggle between screens, graphs it is very frustrating…”Conversations like these tell us exactly where our product fits into the typical workday of a hospitality analytics user. And by aligning these stories to our customer personas, we can brainstorm on the possible product features.The Magic Trick to Remember While Designing A New ExperienceWe Are Evolving in Tandem with the Digital Era These are small moves that make a big difference. When it comes to UI in hospitality analytics, success lies in the details. That’s why we are also exploring elements like the addition of white space and a Dark Mode setting that helps customers access our products in any scenario. At RateGain, our mission is to bring comfort, convenience, and confidence to hospitality brands so they can speed up the decision-making process. We are starting with our flagship products – that is AirGain, Optima, and Parity, eager to extend these innovations to our entire lineup of offerings.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaurav-Lal.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Gaurav Lal<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" style=""vertical-align: top;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nSenior Vice President – Product Design\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/why-ux-is-instrumental-for-revenue-management/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RateGain-Leveraging-UI-to-Create-Value_Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RateGain-Leveraging-UI-to-Create-Value_Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaurav-Lal.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,Blog,,,Product Design,User experience,,,,,,0
65632842a3f6fc78b8eba244,1719311685,Visualizing Data Like a Pro: The Key to Unlock the Data Gold Mine,"December 17, 2019","With digitization underway at organizations of all sizes across industries, data is establishing itself as the most critical factor for ensuring success. Companies use data to make informed decisions about product design, marketing and hotel distribution strategy, customer experience, manufacturing operations, and more. Accelerating the process of converting data to insights to decisions is critical to achieving a competitive edge and consistent business growth. But, what is stopping enterprises from making the best use of that omnipresent data? Data explosion – there is too much data to be collected, analyzed and acted upon.Data is continuously being generated from business operations, customer interactions, financial transactions, and more, making it difficult for business executives to derive actionable insights from it at the same pace. According to some studies the total amount of data created across the globe will cross 175 zetabytes in 2025. In such a scenario, how can businesses extract value from data? While there is a plethora of analytics tools and platforms available in the market that churn the data and promote informed decision making, we will be discussing a key aspect of data intelligence – data visualization. At those high data volumes, data visualization becomes a mammoth task and needs to be augmented using conversational UI with artificial intelligence and machine learning working in the background.Table of Contents Picturing the one-zeros Data visualization is not new to us. Humans have been finding ways to understand data with graphical representations that help consumers of that data to draw meaning from numbers, interpret data trends and bolster decision making. In recent years, business executives have relied heavily on Excel to collate and analyze data and share insights. However, with the volume, variety and velocity of data growing manifold, it has become increasingly impossible to scale up data intelligence processes with Excel. Newer tools and platforms such as Tableau have emerged to tackle the unique challenges of Big Data. Business intelligence (BI) as a domain now has many enthusiasts – both organizations trying to derive value from data and organizations building leading-edge BI solutions. Business intelligence has been proven useful as it makes data more rich and insightful, simplifying decision making on complex problems.In the travel and hospitality space, in-depth data insights into customer behavior, operational performance and market dynamics can have a significant impact on revenue growth and profitability. And gaining that intelligence from data would require companies relying on traditional data tools and technologies to overhaul their existing analytics landscape, making way for a faster data to insights lifecycle. In a fast-paced business environment where organizational efficiency is key, spending considerable time and effort on reading and interpreting long Excel sheets seems wasteful and unnecessary. Business users in the travel and hospitality space are looking to identify trends quickly and take appropriate actions in real time. They want a single, holistic view of their data which may be spread across geographies, disparate systems and processes, and departments. Unearthing the meaning in data Depending on who is consuming the data, their data visualization needs may differ. Let’s consider three user profiles:That brings the idea of ‘adaptable data visualization’ to the forefront. Not all users would like to see data insights presented in the same manner – some would like it to be more granular and rich, while others may prefer a 10,000-feet view of their data. The idea is to get rid of elements that might not pique the interest of the user or may be irrelevant to them.By providing easy to consume insights upfront and empowering the user to construct granular views and manipulate data based on their business requirements, companies can gain the trust of the ‘controller’ and ‘digger’ personas. That yields itself well to organizations looking to build a robust data-centric culture where “every single person — regardless of expertise or tenure – should be enabled to make better decisions based on data.” How to drive BI excellence for your customer Define BI objectives – At the outset, it is important outline what level of intelligence you are looking to offer with your BI implementation. Define the inputs and outputs and determine how you will process the data.Take a funnel approach – Companies must build a funnel view for effective data consumption – know what is required on the dashboard and allow users to dig deeper depending on the insights they need. Funnel views offer the flexibility and superior user experience that is necessary for promoting data centricity across the organization. Moreover, choosing the right graph type to keep the visualization simple and interactive can help in boosting engagement and presenting data in a more consumable manner.Don’t contain everything in one dashboard – The dashboard is to be used as a health meter, where everyday someone logs in to see what’s working and what’s broken. Cluttering it with too much information will defeat the purpose for which it was built – delivering insights that are easy to understand.Choose colors carefully – Interestingly, colors also play a significant role in ensuring effectiveness of data intelligence. Colors are not just used for aesthetics, but they convey meaning, drawing your attention towards critical information. A common example is that of using ‘red’ and ‘green’ while indicating losses and gains. Those colors alert the users to investigate further and contain the losses. According to some experts, color in data visualization can also be used a tool to invoke emotion and set the tone for the audience.\n\nDeploy the right BI engine – Selecting a robust, scalable and future-ready BI engine that reduces time to insights is necessary to scale up your BI program successfully. A BI engine that can quickly ingest disparate data, filter out data based on business requirements, all the while ensuring data consistency and integrity, may prove to be your best bet. While making the choice, you must consider cost efficiency, scalability, and interoperability of the solution. Discussing all the ‘what-if’ scenarios may be important to the decision-making process, however, testing the engine with actual business users will ensure the choice you make delivers the expected returns. Conclusion From my extensive experience of working with global organizations looking to accelerate time to value associated with data and analytics projects, I have realized the important role that data visualization plays in ensuring success. With the learnings I have had over the years by looking at how users consume data, I firmly believe refining your data visualization practices is paramount if delivering value to the end user in the form of actionable insights is your primary objective. The next time you see a chart, table or page in a data analysis report which seems unnecessary or fragmented, go ahead and get rid of it. Keeping it simple and intuitive is what works – every single time.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaurav-Lal.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" /> Gaurav Lal\n\n\n\nSenior Vice President – Product Design\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/visualizing-data-like-a-pro-the-key-to-unlock-the-data-gold-mine/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Visualizing-Data-Like-a-Pro-The-Key-to-Unlock-the-Data-Gold-Mine.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Visualizing-Data-Like-a-Pro-The-Key-to-Unlock-the-Data-Gold-Mine.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaurav-Lal.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,Blog,,,Data Visualizing,Product Design,User experience,Visualizing,,,,0
65632844a3f6fc78b8eba246,494965348,Smart Shopping for Data: Driving Analytics Excellence in the Airlines Industry,"December 4, 2019","Airlines today leverage terabytes of data to gather actionable insights that influence decision making – from revenue management and route planning to customer behavior mapping and MRO management – data is what enables them to ensure profitability and efficiency. Companies store historical data, from as far back as three years, to analyze trends for pricing and prepare better for seasonal shifts in demand. Moreover, with omnichannel marketing and sales becoming the norm, data is the cornerstone of business enablement; and staying ahead of the competition is largely dependent on which player can monetize data more effectively. Hence, it is imperative that airlines track granular market movements with on-demand reports and market dynamics to execute pricing decisions that resonate with millennial travelers.However, gathering, storing and managing large volumes of customer data containing personally identifiable information (PII) can prove to be expensive, effort-intensive and may expose companies to compliance risks associated with stringent data privacy regulations like the GDPR. Furthermore, knowing what data to acquire, how much of it to store and for how long is a complex equation to solve – one which requires deep domain expertise, technical prowess and understanding of the latest market trends. Too much and your costs will skyrocket, too little and you compromise on the quality of insights you can derive from that data.Table of ContentsThe Opportunity Cost of Data Millennials and new-age business travelers are living their lives on the go. They are digitally-savvy and always connected to the internet. Consequently, most of their interactions with airlines are via digital channels – websites, social media, travel booking portals, mobile applications, and more. That implies there is no dearth of data which can be used to gain actionable insights for detecting revenue leakage and ensuring maximum revenue realization.\n\nEnabling accurate, data-driven decision making however requires aviation companies to aggregate the right data points. For instance, understanding customer preference requires information such as departure and arrival time, checked-in luggage, dietary preferences, destination, in-flight retail engagements, and such. A combination of those data points helps analysts to deduce critical insights into what a customer is looking for and how much they are willing to pay for the service. Furthermore, it helps them predict demand, which affects other functions across the value chain, including airline pricing strategy, route planning, marketing promotion, order management, and maintenance scheduling.The inability to gather the right data (or the optimal volume of data points) can prove to be detrimental to the operational performance and market share of the airline, resulting in significant financial impact. You may ask, why is that the opportunity cost of data? The answer is not straightforward and may require an in-depth analysis of your airline operations, customer landscape and existing technology environment. However, the cost you may incur by not leveraging data optimally can be calculated in terms of revenue leakage, customer churn and operational inefficiencies that could have been avoided by putting in place a robust data management and analytics strategy.How Much is Too Much On the flip side, storing and processing excessive volumes and types of data can have damaging effects as well. Managing unnecessary data translates to greater chances of errors in analysis, higher storage costs, wasted effort, and most importantly, insights that may not be as focused as you would like them to be. It would almost be like finding a needle in a haystack, where analysts would be sifting through a lot of noise to unearth valuable information.Some industry experts call it “data saturation,” and it is a serious problem for organizations looking to translate data to insights to actual revenue. While our ability to store more data has increased exponentially, our capabilities to support, filter and manage the data have not kept up.So, What is the Solution? The answer lies in being ‘optimal’. Organizations need to determine the sweet spot that balances too much with too little. In an industry like aviation industry which is expected to see 1 billion air-taxi flights by 2030, it’s easier said than done. Ginormous amounts of data make it extremely difficult to arrive at the optimum levels enough for deriving actionable intelligence.One of the ways, we are solving this problem at RateGain is by “Smart Shopping” – a novel approach that involves analyzing your business intelligence and reporting needs on a real-time basis and suggesting how much data you need to fulfill those needs. The approach is dynamic, hyper-customizable, and closely aligned with the strategic business objectives of a client. We study their business processes, analyze the available data, perform factor analysis and consult on the right type and size of data to be stored and processed. As a result, clients experience an accelerated data to decisions journey with improved Big Data return on investment.ConclusionMastering Big Data management and analytics is the key to achieving competitive advantage, improving responsiveness to market opportunities and streamlining business operations in the aviation industry. Airlines may make strategic investments in underlying data technology, hire the best talent and enable digital customer journeys to gather more data, however, that strenuous effort may go in vain if a prudent data management policy is not defined.\n\nTo learn how RateGain helps airlines design and implement holistic solutions to make the most of their data, write to marketing@rategain.comAbout the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Shikha-chadha-1.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" /> Shikha Chadha<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nVice President – Product Management\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/smart-shopping-for-data-driving-analytics-excellence-in-the-airlines-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Smart-Shopping-for-Data-Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Smart-Shopping-for-Data-Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Shikha-chadha-1.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,Airlines,Smart Shopping,,,,,,0
65632845a3f6fc78b8eba248,-1075977197,"Mr. Hotelier, Four Signs It is Time to Change your Distribution Partner","November 29, 2019","For the hotel industry, distribution is at the core of revenue success. But the truth is that while technology, customer profiles and buying habits have changed dramatically, hoteliers have been sluggish in reviewing and revamping their distribution eco-systems. Many continue to remain dependent on Property Management Systems (PMS´), Central Reservation Systems (CRS´), old fashioned Channel Managers, Revenue Management Systems (RMS´), & with business intelligence tools that were deployed with great love & attention at the same time the hotel was opened, last refurbished or maybe the last time they changed ownership group! It is understandable why hotels have been lethargic. Many have signed contracts with partners up to ten or more years ago, invested years of blood, sweat & tears to build an understanding & flow that they feel works for them and now worry that they don’t have the time to go out, rip up all of that and potentially start from zero again. These hoteliers risk being left behind newer & tech savvy players like Selina and Oyo and are blinkered to all of what is truly possible in the market today.Without doubt, the hospitality industry today is fast-paced. Innovative solutions are coming up all the time. There are new schools of thought challenging old industry tenets and processes constantly. Plus there is the almost “scary” new competition set to hotels emerging in the form of alternative accommodation, non-traditional players, & many disruptor businesses. The industry should recognize that given the circumstances it is normal to shop around for new distribution partners too —and that it is also an urgent need in order to cater for the new wave of traveller ahead.Looking for new distribution partners can be daunting (a bit like considering open heart surgery for some hoteliers). Mapping new needs can be overwhelming, simplifying the contracting process can take time and the new partnership options can be confusing (often people “think” they are comparing “apples with apples” and risk finding out post agreement that they traded some delicious apples for a pack of seeds, from which, if they reinvest lots of TLC & time, could grow in to their own apple tree – the problem being they don’t have the time to do so). No one needs to live in the past through a fear of change and no one needs to be overwhelmed by the prospect of new. There are experienced organizations that can help manage the project of revitalizing your distribution partner (& avoid both the elements of panic & pain entirely).To help you evaluate where your business stands, here are the top four signs that you need a new distribution partner:Table of ContentsSign #1Your partners are not updating you on new trends and best practices: New channels are mushrooming. Currently, there are over 400 OTAs, including all Global OTA’s, Meta-search Websites, OTA for hostels, vacation homes and properties, group bookings, business travel websites and many more[i]. There are new trends to exploit. The market is abuzz with fresh marketing best practices and new standard operating processes. But your current partners either don’t know of these changes or don’t communicate with you enough to call up and assess the impact of them on your business. This is a clear sign that you could be in trouble (maybe you feel that they valued your voice & thoughts more when you were in the sales process with them?).The business environment in the hotel industry is driving major consolidation through acquisitions. Some of the biggest players are growing rapidly through innovative partnerships and buy outs implying the focus is on integration of services and solutions. Unknown to you, the consolidation and integration within our industry may unleash a sudden change in your business plans.What you need is a distribution partner that understands the industry and is concerned about you. If your distribution partner is providing you with a trusted account manager, who has a finger on the pulse of the industry, & has time to regularly speak with you then you are in good hands. But our advice is to reflect on the following questions, “Is my distribution partner standing still with the rest of the traditional industry? Or is my partner moving forward in terms of building domain expertise, thought leadership and new technology adoption?” For example, RateGain’s acquisition of DHISCO, for end-to-end distribution, and BCV, that manages guest social media profiles to maximize their lifetime value, serves as a reasonable benchmark around a company not sitting still.Sign #2You have not re-negotiated partner fees or shopped around for new distribution options for many years: Many contracts with the “traditional distribution partners” have been signed a long time ago. Meanwhile, the cost of distribution has gone down dramatically in many areas. It´s imperative that you make sure you are not being over charged by your current distribution partner. Keep in mind that on some channels transaction fees that were not so long ago over €7 have now gone down to an industry average of around €3. Also consider if your PMS cost is competitive to the people you see at trade shows? And are GDS pass thru fees all equal? (or are some more equal than others? Do you have the chance to participate in great consortia packages to drive additional revenue?) The answer to many of these may result in a surprising reality check.Metasearch traffic will continue to grow and account for more than 45% of unique visitors to travel sites[ii]. Does your distribution partner assist you with more than just a connection to them but also monitoring tools to help evaluate your performance against others on them? These are complex considerations which hoteliers must understand and leverage so that they can make their marketing dollars go the extra mile.Sign #3Your distribution partner is not doing quarterly business reviews with you: Human interaction is critical to healthy outcomes with distribution partners. One way of achieving this is through joint quarterly business reviews. But many hotels don’t even have a named account manager, let alone the practice of routine, calendared reviews. In many cases hoteliers are required to raise a ticket in their partner’s customer management system if they need assistance or to report that a system needs attention. Be sure, if your partner is not keen on doing regular reviews, you are missing out on several tricks that can improve distribution and revenue. Here is why: When you meet your partner, it is exactly like what happens in real life—you are able to express your problems & desires better, the partner is able to feel your pain, understand you even, and fix issues in a manner that work for you best, first time, every time.It doesn’t make sense to work with someone where no one recognizes you at all. It is futile to continue with partners who aren’t listening to your business needs nor paying attention to your opinions because, instead, they are focused on the next big sales or resolving (trouble) tickets and ultimately attending to the people who shout (or complain) the loudest.Sign #4Your distribution partner has not shared their product roadmap with you: How can you be certain that your distribution partner is ready to back your future business plans unless they share the roadmap of their product with you? In reality, very few distribution partners do this. They don’t take feedback; they don’t always find it possible to keep their promises; you don’t know what they are going to do next and therefore cannot plan to leverage their product enhancements; and they don’t always have the key connections that would accelerate your business. If partnering with them causes more pain and stress than it would if you were not with them then this is obviously not a good sign. Just consider what you do in your personal life when a partner causes you more stress & strain by being with them than being alone, you leave them… – there´s no reason why you shouldn´t do the same when this happens in your work life either.The trick for smart hotel executives grappling with the challenges of distribution is to look for partners who are significantly innovative, who are constantly trawling data to intelligently understand the channels that others like you are using (and then quickly pass along that information to you), that auto correct parity issues and proactively connect you with new channels seamlessly, are launching new services before you have even considered them, & invite your opinion to be heard proactively.In summary, consider this: Are you with your current distribution partner due to comfort or fear of new? Is your distribution partner ready with 100% their own systems to cater to your needs? (no white labels or need to plug in several other tools to achieve what others can already do today?), if your partner has a booking engine then can it work with metasearch? Do they understand the data behind reservations distribution & market conditions? If they have GDS connectivity, do they also offer consortia? if they provide channel management then do they have all channels relevant in your market? And are they able to communicate with you in your own languages? (plus speak multiple other key languages for your wider GEO?), Do you know the name of your account manager? When did you last meet your account manager? Do they invite feedback proactively? Ask your distribution partner these tough questions, shop around, and sign up new partners who are ready for your future today. If you are a victim of any two of the four signs, you are not alone and know that it is time to change your distribution partner.A mix of expertise, outside-the-box innovation and consistently growing technological assets have ensured RateGain successfully supports 125,000+ hotel properties globally, influencing $13 Bn in revenue[iii].

65632846a3f6fc78b8eba24a,1283623273,Adopting SCRUM in the Organization’s People Processes,"November 22, 2019","The Scrum Book of knowledge has defined scrum as an adaptive, fast, and flexible methodology which is designed to deliver significant value to a project. Scrum ensures that there is transparency in communication, and it creates an environment of continuous growth.According to Jeff Sutherland (the co-creator of Scrum), “SCRUM is the art of doing twice the work in half the time”.Nowadays, the HR teams across industries are exploring various methods to manage volatility, adaptability to strengthen the organizations by applying different agile approaches to their people processes. Incorporating these methods into human resources allows to take quick actions and build an organizational culture that is more responsive and satisfactory to the needs of the stakeholders. Agile methodology came into existence in early 2000 as a better approach to software development. With waterfall approach becoming less popular, agile methodology is now being used in over 94% in all software companies. The HR team for such organizations needs to be more responsive to the ever-changing needs of the organization. Incorporating the agile values, namely- simplicity, adaptability, transparency, and unity, can help improve HR services.In today’s ever-changing world, business needs are also varying, which makes adaptability essential. While focusing on adaptability, it is also vital that one should not shut their eyes on simplicity while designing the HR programs to avoid any confusion later. It is also crucial that HR does not work in silos or at cross-purpose with the core business. Organisations run at the speed of trust! Thus, transparency is critical to gain the confidence of managers and other stakeholders.Furthermore, in an agile organisation, the HR team needs to manage change within the organisation. There has to be a faster response time in HR’s services from planning and hiring people to develop them. Building a SCRUM organisation needs a culture of empowerment where employees have enough freedom to share their viewpoint and fewer dependencies to respond to the needs of customers. It is the job of HR to create such a culture. The “SCRUM Model of HR” states that HR’s role is not just to implement control mechanism and execution of different processes and to manage each of them, but rather to facilitate and improve organisational agility by not enforcing over-engineered processes.At RateGain, we ensure that we practice agility in our HR processes. Some of the strategies we use to make this practice efficient are:Training leaders to act as mentors and not just supervisors at all levels Strong focus is given on this strategy through various leadership development programs and  employee-employer interactions.Establishing each system with the utmost transparency Transparency in all processes i.e., What are our goals, Accountability of projects, who are our experts? Even a software engineer who codes would know what the organisation’s BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) is, what are our 3HAGs (3 Years Highly Achievable Goals), and about our yearly targets.Building an organizational culture of constant learningWe believe it is important to Play to Learn and not necessarily win. Nurturing a growth mindset and share one’s learning with others should be of utmost importanceSharing Direct FeedbackWe strongly believe that establishing transparent appraisal processes and driving 360 feedback are some of the ways by which HR can drive agility in sharing direct feedback.Hiring and Promoting “A” playersRateGain focuses on hiring and promoting the “A” (the top talent in the market) players. HR function should aim to promote experts and not just managers.Constructive and meaningful engagement over just funGone are the days when celebrating birthday cakes and taking employees to the pubs for engagement was enough. Employees look forward to more than this before joining an organisation. Thus, programs on career progression, employee wellness, talent management, and other development journeys are also needed to attract and retain top talent.Agile principles play an essential part in supporting continuous learning, transparent processes, and talent acquisition. Here are some suggestion to Agile HR-Human Resources, today, is responsible for redefining the workplace experience and engaging employees never like before. For an organization to effectively adopt Agile methodology, all departments need to be involved equally. Being agile turns the HR department into an aware and responsive team which evolves the overall company and its culture positively.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sahil.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Sahil Sharma<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" width=""25"" height=""50"" />\n\nVice President- Global Human Capital\n\nRateGainSahil, an integral part of RateGain’s Core Leadership team is responsible for the company’s people strategy, HR operations and organization development.

65632849a3f6fc78b8eba24c,-90049193,How to Deliver Value In The Era Of Hospitality Industry Consolidation?,"November 19, 2019","A common topic at travel conferences and in travel publication is that of consolidation, on both the supply and demand side of the equation. While the benefits for the parties of the consolidation seem clear on the surface, are they truly taking advantage of the economies of scale while fending off new entrants into the industry?Consolidation is a common occurrence in industries that have seen the same long-term growth as the hotel industry. According to a 2019 Deloitte travel industry outlook, the hotel industry grew with a steady 6.0% CAGR from 2009 to 2017. It only makes sense for hotel brands to take advantage of strong revenue while leveraging consolidation to increase profit margins.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone wp-image-4738 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Deloitte-2019-US-Travel-and-Hospitality-Outlook-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""449"" />Table of ContentsHotels are not AirlinesFor those that have followed the travel industry for some time, you might draw the conclusion that the hotel industry is following a very similar trajectory to that of the airline industry. The airline industry went through considerable consolidation over the past few decades to now be dominated by a few global players. The hospitality industry has seen a similar consolidation this decade and you might draw the conclusion that we’re not far off with broad domination by global hospitality chains such as IHG, Marriott, Hilton and Wyndham for the upcoming few decades. While there is certainty some validity to that argument, the hospitality software companies has internal and external factors that are not prevalent in the airline industry until technology drastically shifts the way we travel. The ways you can differentiate yourself in the airline industry are just not as numerous as they are in the hospitality industry. Just take the rise of Airbnb as an example. The success of Airbnb was spurred by changes in consumer preferences, met by an expansion in consumer choice. I would argue that such a change is impossible in the airline industry. If the Uber of airlines comes to the market, I can safely say I’d stick with the globally dominant players. The risk would surely be greater than a night on sub-par linens!Further, the hotel industry is not as dynamic and flexible as the airlines industry. Assets in the airline industry can easily be redirected to new and more profitable routes. That’s not as easy on the hotel industry. When you consider the shifting landscape and competition in travel this dilemma becomes an important one. Take the U.S. inbound travel market for example, while travel to places like Portugal and Vietnam are growing by 20-20% annually, total arrivals to the U.S. only grew by 0.7% in 2017.Consolidation with InnovationThe opportunity for disruption in the hospitality industry will always be there, and I would argue that’s a good thing. Several of the large hospitality chains have created or acquired boutique brands in response to changing consumer preferences. Disruption has kept the industry from innovating at the same pace as other industries, which is not easy in an industry so dependent on long-term capital investment. So, while large mergers have consolidated some power with a few multinationals, the mergers tend to focus on innovation and improving guest offerings. And that’s a good thing! There’s still room for “incubator” innovation to be successful by capitalizing on changes in travel trends. Just look at the rapidly growing hotel chain, Selina, which is now moving into Europe after tremendous success in South America.Goliath vs. GoliathOn the demand side, we’ve seen a similar consolidation and dominance by a few players over the last decade. But the dynamics couldn’t be more different than on the supply side. Rather than disruption from small innovative concepts, disruptive threats are coming from adjacent technology giants, namely Facebook, Google and Amazon. They are simply leveraging their huge customer base to make inroads into the highly lucrative and ever-growing travel industry. As of now, there’s no signs that they will fail. Where we are seeing some start-up-like innovation is in traditionally under-served types of travel such as business travel, group travel, or emerging niche travel. But comparing these to the giants in travel sales makes them seem insignificant in terms of impact on individual hoteliers or travel product providers.In Change there’s Always OpportunityAs any investor or entrepreneur will tell you, where there is change there’s opportunity. While many of us find the complexities of the financial markets hard to decipher as individual investors, I would argue that the travel industry as a whole is far more complex. So, it can be hard to spot where the opportunities are in an industry that is seeing consolidation on all fronts causing constant change. While I don’t have the insider tip that will get you rich overnight, there are ways to create a strong position for yourself in the midst of this change. This in itself presents an opportunity to differentiate yourself and stay competitive. Surprisingly these tips bare some similarities to that you might hear from your financial advisor.Always DiversifyWhether you’re on the supply or demand-side of hospitality, diversification is key. If you’re a travel seller, it may be obvious that diversifying your supply will meet a more diverse set of consumer needs. But just like in financial markets it also insulates you from risk, in this case brought on from changes in consumer preferences. You will want to be geographically diverse, while spanning a wide range of accommodation options and price-points. Make sure you can offer that boutique hotel in Bali as well as the budget chain property in Denton, Ohio.Diversification will further insulate you to some extent from a potential economic downturn. We know one is coming. The question is only when. While some will want you to believe that day is tomorrow, the common indicators are still not there. In the U.S. only 25% of submarkets are seeing negative RevPar, while strong downturn indicators have typically been 40-45% of the market seeing negative RevPar. Again, negative RevPar in these submarkets may have more to do with shifting consumer travel preferences than being evidence of a looming recession.If you’re on the supply side of hospitality don’t be afraid to leverage travel sellers as a part of your direct booking strategy. But in addition to the big players, make sure you branch out and consider smaller travel sellers as part of your overall strategy. Consider up and coming business travel sellers, rising regional OTA’s from across the world, as well as wholesalers and tour operators. While they may be slow to produce at first, playing the long game in untapped markets can help create a name for yourself and drive those profitable repeat stays that book direct.Find the Right PartnerBuilding on the point of diversification, it’s time for you to consolidate. Whether you’re a travel seller or accommodation provider, your opportunity is in diving right into the markets, not in the various ways of getting there. Experimenting with and in various source markets can be tough enough and the last thing you need is distraction. Find a technology partner that can reach a broad range of markets without the constraints of integrations or technology standards. Is your technology partner overly dominant in one market or another? Are they confined to certain integrations or models of distribution (push vs. pull etc)? These scenarios often lead accommodation providers as well as travel sellers to maintain a multitude of partners in a patch-work attempt to gain broad coverage. While it may save some pennies or give you an extra connection in the short term, in the long-term it’s sure to distract from true innovation. Rather chose a technology partner that connect you to a broad set of markets, as well as meet a broader set of your technology needs.So while there’s nothing you can do about the range of change in the industry, I’ll give you the same advice my parents gave me. Keep good friends and keep your options open!About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dave-1.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Dave Kolankarai<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nSenior Vice President Account Management\n\nRateGainDave is an accomplished distribution executive with 20+ years of experience in the travel & hospitality industry.

6563284ba3f6fc78b8eba24e,-28837588,What will define Long Term Success for Airlines,"November 11, 2019","Table of ContentsData-driven stable systems v/s Feature-Rich EcosystemsWe today live in a world where we now have an app for everything. Today we have more than 5.5 million apps available across all app stores with over 178.1 billion downloads every year, suggesting that on an average each of the 2.7 billion mobile users try more than 65 apps.This clearly tells us that we have a technological solution available to solve every type of challenge faced by an organization or by you.For all of us who are end-users, we witness these applications continuously introducing new features and updates to accommodate our needs as well as to increase the MAU.However, when applying this specifically to solving business problems, this leaves all of us with a few questionsThe induction of technologies like the Internet of Things and connected devices have led to an increase in the amount of data generated. For instance, the current model of A-350 generates 2.5 terabytes of data per day. As a result, the challenges of getting actual insights from data are enormous. Teams across organizations today are trying to win this never-ending race by building point solutions or features that help them solve a business problem in the short-term.The industry is currently working with data in a more feature-centric manner. So, the approach works on the feature-to-data methodology. On the contrary, systems need to be data-centric. So, the focus must be on the different components of the data lifecycle. The churned data must then be analyzed to see the features that it can best support. Eventually, this approach is expected to provide insights, which will be more productive and accurate.The Tradeoff Between Feature-Rich and Data-Centric EcosystemsWith the rising wave to develop technologically driven ecosystems, providers are forced to focus their attention on features instead of strong frameworks. According to a report, the artificial intelligence market for airlines is expected to hit USD 2.2 billion by 2025, with the focus on passenger experience and the Internet of Things, among top trends.\n\nWhile Digital teams plan for the implementation and use-cases of these technologies, most airlines have not really figured out how they would process data across these systems and derive the right insight.Most airlines work on the approach that advocates collating data and acting on it with the help of visualizations and prediction agendas, missing out on the acquisition and processing part, to a great degree.With airlines wanting it all and supporting practically everything from social media analytics, speech analytics, contact centers, and revenue model analytics, the issue is particularly escalated in the scenario where the number of data sources is ever increasing. It is no longer possible to collate all the data and just act. It is more important to process data correctly before actionable results can be made available.Besides this, the current ecosystem depends on disparate systems for supporting different features, which requires vertical integration. These individual systems are offered by a multitude of technology partners. This undeniably makes the process of integration rather challenging.TAcquisition and Processing for System AccuracyThe data lifecycle is largely divided into four phases. In the first phase, data is acquired and collated. Storage and processing of data occur in the second and third phases, respectively. Lastly, only after the results are available that are visualized and presented to the user. Typically, in order to evaluate a system, two evaluation metrics are computed, which include accuracy and performance.Depending on the application concerned, it is determined as to which of these evaluation metrics is more significant. With that said, the performance metric for a system comes into picture only once the desired accuracy has been achieved. For all data analytical applications, accuracy largely depends on two phases namely, acquisition and processing.Storage, processing, and visualization majorly affect the performance of the system. While storage infrastructure and applied processing techniques have a significant impact on response time and other similar performance metrics, visualizations determine user-friendliness and usability of the system.If the collected data is irrelevant, insufficient or inaccurate, the results cannot be expected to be any better. According to Gartner’s research, businesses lose an annual average of USD 9.7 million from their revenue because of poor data quality. The same holds true for the applied processing techniques. This makes it unavoidable for airlines and providers to create ecosystems with robust acquisition and processing components instead of focusing on visualizations in view of the fact that quality and accuracy of visualizations depending on the efficacy of the backend system.ConclusionAlthough the market is showing a drift towards feature-rich ecosystems, compromising on the strength of the ecosystem to support them, is not advisable. Data acquisition and processing are the most crucial sub-systems for a robust ecosystem. It is only if the data is collected suitably and processed aptly that it will be used for analytics. Feature-rich ecosystems are mere deceptions as far as a competitive advantage is concerned. Airlines and providers need to focus on the strength of the core system. Data-driven ecosystems can play a significant role in this, to create a lasting impact on the industry.  https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/that-s-data-science-airbus-puts-10-000-sensors-in-every-single\n\n https://www.wns.com/insights/articles/articledetail/579/top-trends-for-the-global-airline-industry\n\nhttps://www.mindtree.com/blog/recent-digital-trends-airline-industry\n\nAbout the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shikha-chadhha-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Shikha Chadha \n\nVice President – Product Management\n\nRateGain\n\nLeading Product Management Group and driving Engineering/DevOps team with a vision of creating most innovative price intelligence and revenue management products in airline technology. ",https://rategain.com/blog/what-will-define-long-term-success-for-airlines/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/airline.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/airline.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shikha-chadhha-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,,,AirGain,Airline,Airline Revenue Managers,,,,,0
6563284ca3f6fc78b8eba250,1533294240,Challenges for Airline Revenue Managers Beyond 2020,"October 23, 2019","This year marks the end of a landmark decade for digitization and technological adoption. Path breaking technologies like artificial intelligence and personalization have been incorporated into business functions to facilitate strategy execution. The fact that 72% of business leaders[1] believe that AI is synonymous with ‘business advantage’ attests this growing shift.This year has manifested numerous ups and downs for the airline industry. Some of the disruptions include the Boeing Saga, rise in Google flights and airspace limitations between countries leading to further challenges in airline revenue management. Considering the complexity of the situation and its recurring nature, AI and technological support are seen as critical drivers for improving efficiency of the ecosystem in this testing time.The airline industry has focused on NPS and customer issues for product/service improvement with as many as two-third[2] of the companies using NPS to track customer experience. However, this method is not applicable for identification of present and probable challenges faced by revenue managers. Over the last few months my team interviewed more than 45 senior managers from different airline providers to gain insights on their anticipations for the future of airline industry and the role of data in compelling a positive change; in response of which four trends were identified.Table of ContentsLesson 1: NDC will lead to DisparityOne of the biggest challenges faced by airline industry today stems from the fact that NDC generates NPC. A growing trend can be seen in favor of NDC and personalization. According to latest IATA update, the number of carriers with certified deployments has increased from 50 in 2017 to 65 in 2019[3]. This gives undue leverage to a single channel. On the contrary, major focus of the strategy should be to talk to sales channels and understand how they would ensure that all ancillary components are displayed across all channels.Lesson 2: Growing Need for Insights in Real-timeToday, airlines face several static and dynamic challenges because of which revenue managers are required to recalibrate their strategy in real-time. This brings in a growing need for fresh data that can to be delivered quickly.\n\nThe next generation of revenue management solutions requires a holistic view of network partner data as well as total passenger value. Therefore, real time insight into total revenue for every date of departure for every flight in each market is required, emphasizing on the need for live data.\n\nIn addition, time is most crucial. Airlines that lack access to real-time data and insights, experience delayed and inaccurate decision-making, which in turn has a direct impact on market share, revenue and structure of their product offerings in comparison to that of their competitors.Lesson 3: Persona-Based PricingDynamic pricing has hit almost every ecommerce ensemble, with the airline industry adopting it like no other. Persona-based pricing promises to take dynamic pricing to another level with price update based of customer information and demand.\n\nThere are legal issues involved because while some customers are expected to benefit, others may feel trapped because of the non-transparent system. However, the next 5-10 years[4] is not expected to see any new booking classes and as a result, personalized pricing is expected to stay and grow.Lesson 4: Price ElasticityPrice elasticity, in simple terms, is a measure of the percentage of more passengers who are expected to choose a provider if the price drops by a certain percentage. The aviation industry has for long debated on effective measurement of this metric.\n\nHowever, it continues to be a valuable measure in comprehending scope for commercial opportunities particularly with lowering down of fares. The importance of this metric has particularly increased in view of the growing number of carriers in the transatlantic region, preparing to expand by providing low cost long haul offerings.Looking at the Future As we approach the end of 2019, there are some major takeaways for revenue management companies; the most profound of which stresses on the fact that it is time to not just focus on pricing, but also see look beyond daily challenges to be ready to solve for challenges beyond 2020.In case you also agree with our findings and want to learn how we are solving this for other airlines or believe that there is a different challenge that we have missed out on, let us know by writing to me at shweta.vashishth@rategain.comAbout the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shweta-vashisht-1.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Shweta Vashishth<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nVice President – Sales\n\nRateGain 1. https://cmo.adobe.com/articles/2017/5/15-mind-blowing-stats-about-emerging-technology-tlp-ptr.html#gs.217l2a\n\n2. https://lumoa.me/blog/net-promoter-score-statistics\n\n3. https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/travel/new-distribution-capability-ndc-in-air-travel-airlines-gdss-and-the-impact-on-the-industry/\n\n4. https://blog.blackcurve.com/personalised-airline-pricing-is-here-to-stay ",https://rategain.com/blog/challenges-for-airline-revenue-managers-beyond-2020/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airline-Revenue-Manager-PR-2.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airline-Revenue-Manager-PR-2.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shweta-vashisht-1.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,Blog,,,AirGain,Airline,Airline Revenue Managers,,,,,0
6563284da3f6fc78b8eba252,-25287422,Navigating Constant Consolidation,"October 21, 2019","A common topic at travel conferences and in travel publication is that of consolidation, on both the supply and demand side of the equation. While the benefits for the parties of the consolidation seem clear on the surface, are they truly taking advantage of the economies of scale while fending off new entrants into the industry?Table of ContentsHotels are not AirlinesFor those that have followed the travel industry for some time, you might draw the conclusion that the hotel industry is following a very similar trajectory to that of the airline industry. The airline industry went through considerable consolidation over the past few decades to now be dominated by a few global players. The hospitality industry has seen a similar consolidation this decade and you might draw the conclusion that we’re not far off with broad domination by global hospitality chains such as IHG, Marriott, Hilton and Wyndham for the upcoming few decades. While there is certainty some validity to that argument, the hospitality industry has internal and external factors that are not prevalent in the airline industry until technology drastically shifts the way we travel. The ways you can differentiate yourself in the airline industry are just not as numerous as they are in the hospitality industry. Just take the rise of Airbnb as an example. The success of Airbnb was spurred by changes in consumer preferences, met by an expansion in consumer choice. I would argue that such a change is impossible in the airline industry. If the Uber of airlines comes to the market, I can safely say I’d stick with the globally dominant players. The risk would surely be greater than a night on sub-par linens!Consolidation with InnovationThe opportunity for disruption in the hospitality industry will always be there, and I would argue that’s a good thing. Several of the large hospitality chains have created or acquired boutique brands in response to changing consumer preferences. Disruption has kept the industry from innovating at the same pace as other industries, which is not easy in an industry so dependent on long-term capital investment. So, while large mergers have consolidated some power with a few multinationals, the mergers tend to focus on innovation and improving guest offerings. And that’s a good thing! There’s still room for “incubator” innovation to be successful by capitalizing on changes in travel trends. Just look at the rapidly growing hotel chain, Selina, which is now moving into Europe after tremendous success in South America.Goliath vs. GoliathOn the demand side, we’ve seen a similar consolidation and dominance by a few players over the last decade. But the dynamics couldn’t be more different than on the supply side. Rather than disruption from small innovative concepts, disruptive threats are coming from adjacent technology giants, namely Facebook, Google and Amazon. They are simply leveraging their huge customer base to make inroads into the highly lucrative and ever-growing travel industry. As of now, there’s no signs that they will fail. Where we are seeing some start-up-like innovation is in traditionally under-served types of travel such as business travel, group travel, or emerging niche travel. But comparing these to the giants in travel sales makes them seem insignificant in terms of impact on individual hoteliers or travel product providers.In Change there’s Always OpportunityAs any investor or entrepreneur will tell you, where there is change there’s opportunity. While many of us find the complexities of the financial markets hard to decipher as individual investors, I would argue that the travel industry as a whole is far more complex. So, it can be hard to spot where the opportunities are in an industry that is seeing consolidation on all fronts causing constant change. While I don’t have the insider tip that will get you rich overnight, there are ways to create a strong position for yourself in the midst of this change. This in itself presents an opportunity to differentiate yourself and stay competitive. Surprisingly these tips bare some similarities to that you might hear from your financial advisor.Always DiversifyWhether you’re on the supply or demand-side of hospitality, diversification is key. If you’re a travel seller, it may be obvious that diversifying your supply will meet a more diverse set of consumer needs. But just like in financial markets it also insulates you from risk, in this case brought on from changes in consumer preferences. You will want to be geographically diverse, while spanning a wide range of accommodation options and price-points. Make sure you can offer that boutique hotel in Bali as well as the budget chain property in Denton, Ohio.If you’re on the supply side of hospitality don’t be afraid to leverage travel sellers as a part of your direct booking strategy. But in addition to the big players, make sure you branch out and consider smaller travel sellers as part of your overall strategy. Consider up and coming business travel sellers, rising regional OTA’s from across the world, as well as wholesalers and tour operators. While they may be slow to produce at first, playing the long game in untapped markets can help create a name for yourself and drive those profitable repeat stays that book direct.Find the Right PartnerBuilding on the point of diversification, it’s time for you to consolidate. Whether you’re a travel seller or accommodation provider, your opportunity is in diving right into the markets, not in the various ways of getting there. Experimenting with and in various source markets can be tough enough and the last thing you need is distraction. Find a technology partner that can reach a broad range of markets without the constraints of integrations or technology standards. Is your technology partner overly dominant in one market or another? Are they confined to certain integrations or models of distribution (push vs. pull etc)? These scenarios often lead accommodation providers as well as travel sellers to maintain a multitude of partners in a patch-work attempt to gain broad coverage. While it may save some pennies or give you an extra connection in the short term, in the long-term it’s sure to distract from true innovation. Rather chose a technology partner that connect you to a broad set of markets, as well as meet a broader set of your technology needs.So while there’s nothing you can do about the range of change in the industry, I’ll give you the same advice my parents gave me. Keep good friends and keep your options open!About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shweta-vashisht-1.png"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Dave Kolankarai<img width=""25"" height=""18"" decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png"" alt="""" />\n\nSenior Vice President\n\nDHISCO ",https://rategain.com/blog/navigating-constant-consolidation/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airline-Revenue-Manager-Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airline-Revenue-Manager-Blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shweta-vashisht-1.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linkedin-icon.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,,,AirGain,Airline,Airline Revenue Managers,,,,,0
6563284ea3f6fc78b8eba254,1530957423,Our point of view on Distribution Journey,"October 17, 2019","This is in continuation to my last article which talked about various challenges hoteliers face with respect to distribution technology & why we believe significant changes are required in this space to make it frictionless & rewarding. Since publishing this article, we at RateGain have spent several months diving deep into the pain points of hundreds of distribution leaders across various Hotels and Channel partners to understand their business challenges and what do they want from their distribution technology landscape.Basis this extensive research we have now put a structure to the end to end journey of hospitality distribution right from envisioning the channels to actually producing from these and identifying the friction at each step. This is a step towards our attempt to collaborate with various partners in the ecosystem for smart distribution.Today the realm of an effective distribution channel exceeds beyond distributing rates and inventory between hotels and demand partners. The expectations from distribution managers are not limited to just enabling this exchange but also toIn a nutshell, the new age distribution managers want to invest more of their time in building well thought through hotel distribution strategies for their product & much lesser time in mundane operational tasks.Table of ContentsDistribution Journey Problem<img width=""1150"" height=""450"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hotel-chains-infographic-1-2.png"" alt=""Distribution Journey Problem"" />At RateGain, we believe that the modern hospitality distribution landscape demands more agility, and data based insights to be able to generate maximum value and unlock new revenue creation opportunities. A distribution ecosystem can become a window into creation of new opportunities for both hotels and demand partners if they get a platform which makes it frictionless to recommend the match between the hotel & the channel basis mutual value & enable a seamless connection to start deriving this value quickly. In our view, following are the key steps w.r.t distribution in hospitality.<img width=""1000"" height=""237"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7-stages.png"" alt="""" />While pushing of rates & inventory seems to be solved for, there are significant other steps which have been ignored for past several years. We believe it’s about time to make entire distribution technology smarter. It is our mission to make each and every step smarter & enable a frictionless experience for hoteliers to generate more revenue through most optimal distribution.A smarter distribution would not only lead to data backed decision making, quick access to new sources of demands for hotels but also quick onboarding of new supply across the world for demand partners.Benefits for HotelsBenefits for Demand PartnersA ‘Smarter’ distribution landscape will help all parties in the hospitality distribution ecosystem by enabling data based informed decisions.

I have had the fortune of working with organizations focussed on delivering exceptional experiences to the end user and delivered some innovative products across the globe. Luckily today, most organizations understand the relevance of crafting the right user experience and seem to be investing in the practice to make life easy for your product, sales, after-sales and support teams.User experience has been known to solve every kind of internal as well as external problems that hinder business growth effectively, so what is the new problem that I have found after 19 years of working on multiple programs that I am excited about.The Problem is centered on making the life of revenue and distribution managers simpler. To give more context, revenue and distribution managers are at the center of a hyper competitive yet growing travel industry where they have the responsibility of generating more revenue every day, and both outsell their competitors and generate more revenue for their organization.My new organization, RateGain, works with revenue managers, distribution and marketing managers with insights and distribution technologies to maximize the revenue.The leadership drives this exciting journey at RateGain, which is focused on redefining the current way of working for revenue and distribution managers to help them with clear actions and make the right decisions.I always thought that hospitality and travel extremely process driven industries because they have been running massive operations to perfection for decades.

65632851a3f6fc78b8eba258,417323810,The Last Distribution Challenge,"October 15, 2019","Table of ContentsThe Two Worlds of DistributionTechnological advancements in hospitality distribution have brought on immense opportunities for both hoteliers and travel sellers, including online travel agencies, travel management companies, and the trusted travel agency community. But at the same time, the way that hospitality distribution has been evolving has hampered progress compared to similar industries. Two decades ago, only large hotel chains had access to the right technology, enabling connectivity between the hotel and the reseller. With the advent of the channel manager, independent hoteliers were able to much more effectively manage their distribution. While CRS-level connectivity technology, often called a switch, evolved to handle massive complexity and scale, channel managers tended to be nimbler. Simpler and standardized APIs allowed for quicker implementation, both on the side of hoteliers, as well as OTAs and other resellers. In other words, the barrier to entry for smaller hoteliers was lowered by channel managers, while switch technology was the clear choice for large brands and chains.Moving the Goal-PostOver the last two decades, the two technologies have continued to evolve, each with its inherent strengths and challenges. This also meant each technology had its own place in the content sourcing strategy for OTAs and in the distribution strategy for large hotels. Smaller independent hoteliers have often been limited to channel managers, which works well for its intended purposes. For a large hotel chain, the switch has been great for connecting the hotel CRS to the GDS and to medium to large-sized OTAs. To connect to smaller regional OTAs and wholesalers, chain hotels often had to utilize a channel manager at property level via a PMS, which resulted in some loss of control at a hotel’s corporate level. With the growth in travel in emerging markets, such as India and China, this presented some challenges with regional OTAs serving those markets and driving significant traffic. Take China… in this market, Ctrip is by far the largest OTA serving that market and a clear choice for hoteliers wanting to attract Chinese travelers. While, Ctrip does cover 36.6% of the Chinese market, the savvy hotelier will ask “what about the other 63.4%?”. And, it’s a wise question to ask – since most distribution technology providers do connect with Ctrip, competition on the site is stiff. Smaller specialized OTAs, ecommerce platforms, and tech-savvy tour operators are on the rise, making China similar to many other travel markets in terms of travel seller composition. So, for those hotelier’s hungry to implement a uniquely crafted and differentiated distribution strategy – the menu is ever expanding.Push, Pull and Personalization So, what is standing in the way of hoteliers getting creative with their distribution strategy or travel sellers setting themselves apart with a differentiated offering? Unfortunately, the same thing that has plagued the travel industry for decades – technology and connectivity. Similar to the rapid growth days of the internet, many hoteliers are still relying on faxing of reservations, as crazily archaic as that sounds. But more importantly, and unlike many technologies going back decades, there are different standards for connectivity, and different systems and end-points needed to connect, each having evolved independently of one another. I wish I could say that the only choice we struggle with was between a Apple or Android. And of course, there’s the choice between push (sometimes favored by OTAs) and pull (often favored by hoteliers) models of connectivity. While the industry has somewhat trended from pull to push in the past, it is now moving back towards a pull model of connectivity, driven by consumer expectations of personalization and the need to make personalized offers in real time. Still, the push model is not going anywhere in the foreseeable future. Today, both push and pull require heavier infrastructure investments to support shopping and booking traffic, often reserved to larger systems and system providers. Independent hoteliers with a PMS and chain hoteliers with older CRS systems will continue to be constrained by the capacity of their systems. This will once again put most hoteliers at a disadvantage in their ability to deliver a personalized offer, similar to what consumers have come to expect in the Amazon-like world of today. It will at the same time drive OTAs increasingly to deliver a diverse offering to meet a complex set of consumer preferences.An Explosion of Possibilities A little over a year ago when we combined the forces of DHISCO and RateGain, we knew there was tremendous potential for synergies, but we weren’t quite clear on exactly how we would realize them. RateGain’s channel manager, RezGain, and DHISCO’s Switch had both different and leading distribution capabilities. RezGain is great at push, while DHISCO leads in pull. Each also came with rich existing businesses that had traditionally not intersected in the marketplace. On the supply side, DHISCO served every large hotel chain in North America and Europe, along with many with presence outside these regions. Through RezGain, RateGain served thousands of medium-sized, independent hotels across Asia. On the supply side DHISCO is the obvious choice for indirect GDS connectivity, while RezGain has the industry’s largest OTA and wholesale connectivity network. For anyone with a basic knowledge of hospitality distribution, the initial opportunities began to materialize, while the theoretical possibilities were mesmerizing.After some months of frantic whiteboarding and around the clock engineering, we have now unlocked the closest thing to limitless distribution that the hospitality industry has seen. Allowing Push and Pull models of distribution to remain a barrier to connection between supply and demand is a thing of the past. This means that customers now have access to virtually any type of connection between hotel and reseller. Where one partner may have preferred to connect in a specific way, often times the desired connectivity partner had no ability to support that. We have removed those barriers by bringing together the RezGain and DHISCO specialties travel technology. We are, proverbially, putting connectivity square pegs into round holes.I liken RateGain’s advancement in distribution technology to recent developments in voice-enabled translation technology. Just like we can now travel the world and make new connections with people in remote parts of the world without letting language be a barrier, travel sellers and accommodation providers can now connect anywhere in any way. Imagine the plethora of possibilities that are now at the disposal of demand and supply players across the globe.To know more about RateGain’s Smart Distribution capabilities and offerings for supply and demand partners, visit https://rategain.com/hotel-software/overviewAbout the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyle-Moore.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Kyle Moore\n\n\n\nSenior Vice President, Product Management\n\nRateGain Kyle Moore leads the Product Management team at RateGain.

65632852a3f6fc78b8eba25a,-1427083150,Can Car Rental analytics help make better investment decisions?,"October 4, 2019","Have you ever noticed that if you and your friend book an Uber cab for the same route and distance, both of you may be charged differently? That is Uber’s dynamic pricing coming into play! Pricing changes dynamically depending on customer data, local events and demand, besides many other factors.In a market where 78% of the customers consider themselves bargain buyers; dynamic pricing is a winner strategy for customer generation and retention. This is just one example from a host of ways in which technological advancement has changed the way car rentals function and operates.Table of ContentsData is the AnswerData Science has truly made conventional methods obsolete. In this age of data deluge, heaps of data is available. This reservoir can be analyzed to answer innumerable questions. However, the challenge here is no longer to seek answers. Instead, the challenge is to ask innovative questions. Data science and artificial intelligence have been massively adopted, by businesses, with 83% of the adopters known to achieve more than 30% economic benefits from it .Technological progression has allowed car rental companies to use technology for gaining competitive advantage. In fact, these technologies have been the center force behind changing the nature of competition across businesses in the following ways:Many innovative applications for car rentals have been identified, which include demand prediction, rate analysis, price discovery, meeting customer demand and determining customer satisfaction scores.Data Pipeline for Car RentalsCar rental software generates data at multiple levels. Tracking of car movement within and across cities can provide a huge amount of data when accumulated for all the cars running for this business. Analysis of data related to movement of vehicles can provide information related to the following questions:This information can be mighty valuable for rental companies to develop dynamically changing business strategies. For example, if there is aggregation of rental vehicles at a particular location around the same dates every year, this might indicate a repeated demand because of an annual event. A car rental company can accordingly plan for special offers and pricing models to win competitive advantage.Using Data Across DomainsThe beauty of data science comes from the fact that data from one lateral can benefit another lateral in unique and unimaginable ways. Going back to the previous example, an annual event with excessive car rental use also indicates significant tourist inflow, which opens doors of opportunity for hotels and homestays. In a similar manner, data collected from car rentals can be analyzed for the benefit of a plethora of businesses like asset management companies, real estate firms and investment companies, to name a few.Some of the insights that can be directly inferred from car rental data include an analysis of a car rental firm’s health. More specifically, data related to a location can also be indicative of the health of a franchise. This information can be rather useful for investors and insurance or asset management companies to scrutinize the potential of possible investment. On similar lines, other possible insights that this data is capable of giving, include:The analyzed trends and patterns can laterally have an impact on other related parameters. Demand for car rentals has an impact on car ownership patters and trends, which in turn affect the automobile industry.The Bottom LineThe traditional method of conceptualizing a problem and collecting data to support a solution for the problem is bygone. Data science uses live data from different laterals to provide cross-domain insights, saving the costs of data collection and taking decision making to another level altogether. For all this and more, business intelligence is the future of decision making.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Narender.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Narendar Lokwani\n\n\n\nSenior Vice President Car\n\nRateGain",https://rategain.com/blog/can-car-rental-analytics-help-make-better-investment-decisions/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Can-Car-Rental-analytics-help-make-better-investment-decisions-2.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Can-Car-Rental-analytics-help-make-better-investment-decisions-2.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Narender.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Blog,,,Analytics,Car Rental Analytics,Cross Domain Data,Data Analytics,Data science,,,0
65632854a3f6fc78b8eba25c,-1617492044,Top 3 considerations for blueprinting your content transformation,"September 21, 2019","Too many organizations today rely on outdated or inefficient content distribution. Content should be treated as a business asset worthy of being produced efficiently, repurposed effectively and translated prescriptively. Not scattered like seeds with the hope it will grow new business.Do you have a Contenteur? Likely not. What’s needed is to think about content strategically and assign accountability. A Contenteur is the individual at the forefront where content, channels and consumers intersect, delivering compelling customer experiences that drive new revenue opportunities. The individual that orchestrates business initiatives that leverage technology, optimized operations and calibrates multi-channel content delivery.Even if you don’t have a Contenteur, there are three “ingredients” or strategies to address inefficient content distribution:Table of ContentsCONTENT OWNERStart by simply asking “who owns content here?” Too many goals lead to one-off content. Put someone in overall charge of content. Establishing a more holistic view of content production, redundancies and inconsistencies will expose opportunities to address them. Trend is growing towards a Customer Experience owner; why not partner them with the Content Owner to fuel memorable and economically sustainable customer experiences?Without a content strategy, and in spite of best intentions, content can become channel-centric instead of customer-centric.CONTENT STRATEGYContent strategy defines how you are going to use content to meet business objectives and satisfy consumer needs. It ensures that a clear, specific purpose for each content area and evaluates it against this purpose. And content will be created with the goal of making it reusable, rather than by someone who imagines it for a particular channel, product or location.Curation is key to delivering accurate and sustainable content.CONTENT CURATIONCuration guides decisions about content throughout its lifecycle, from concept to archival. Enforce practices that ensure that content will not be internally published or syndicated without a support plan results in a reduced amount of orphaned and stale content contributing to the overall bloat of information. Sustainable content is content you can create and maintain without impacting quality.Our fragmented online environment makes it difficult to scale and maintain relevant customer experiences and the resulting inefficiencies. Consumers and experts tell us that more content is not always the answer.

65632856a3f6fc78b8eba25e,-1908743470,The Path to A Shared Future: Can car rentals help in turning around the industry slowdown ?,"September 11, 2019","Gone are the times when buying a car was one of the first investments of a working professional for the sheer ease and convenience a self-owned vehicle gives you. The Digital consumer single-handedly has altered the entire automotive industry’s supply chain by impacting both production and consumption of goods.Car Manufacturers are trying to adjust to this change on both ends by investing more in features that are preferred by consumers as well as looking to build engines that are low on emission. The transition is resulting in significant supply chain changes for car manufacturers. As per Statista, in the last 20 years, the cost of electronic components in a car has almost doubled from 20% to 35% of the total car cost. This is supposed to be at 50% in the next 10 years.On the consumption side, As app-based aggregators like Uber, Lyft, Grab and Ola continue to launch new offerings in the market, most consumers are now comparing the total cost of ownership including maintenance and parking charges to cost of their monthly cab fares.While Car manufacturers look to build the right strategy to tackle this perception of the consumer, the market is already moving electric cars to the mainstream market and expected to take over the market in a few years. These factors have cumulatively changed the panorama of the global auto industry, which has forced major car companies to initiate multi-faceted alteration in their business plan.Table of ContentsBumps on the Road to OwnershipAccording to an article in the Asian Nikkei Review, The global slow down is triggered by softening of demand in the two fastest-growing car markets of the world, China and India.The article states that China and India, the world’s largest and fourth-largest auto markets, both suffered double-digit drops in sales during the previous quarter ended June, putting global sales on track to shrink for the second consecutive year.The Chinese economic slowdown and a yearlong trade war with the U.S. as well as stricter laws on emissions have dampened the consumer appetite for new cars.Similarly, the Indian market has reported a record fall in passenger vehicle sales with a drop of around 20.55% in 2019. This has been the steepest fall in the last 18 years.These trends can be seen to appear globally as well, with the US auto sales dropping from 2018, by 1.5% in 2019, contributing to the global market situation.Increase in commuting times, rapid urbanization, worsening traffic congestion, increase in CO2 levels has significantly contributed to a rise in shared mobility. Uber averaged 1 million rides per day in 2015. This figure has escalated to 3.5 million in 2018. Besides this, improved coverage of public transport and availability of facilities like carpooling and sharing, have also backed this drift.In a paradigmatic article by McKinsey & Company, it was claimed that one-third of the expected growth in car sales through 2030 will not happen because of shared mobility. In view of the fact that major disruptions like autonomous mobility and electric vehicles are also coming in, the situation is only expected to worsen for the auto industry.Can Car Companies become Service Providers?Apart from the low cost of ownership, the consumer today values convenience and ease of use. These traits of the consumer have helped digital natives like Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify to become multi-billion-dollar businesses. Therefore the fundamental question to ask is can car companies revive their fortunes by following the same principle. Additionally, if car ownership is reducing can car companies move towards providing end-to-end service instead of just selling cars.Some manufacturers have already started designing future mobility solutions that realize the sharing and connectedness requirements of the consumer. For example, the Hyundai Motor Company recently repositioned themselves as a Mobility Solutions Provider that promises to provide convenient and unlimited access to safe transportation while focusing on shared, clean and connected mobility.Companies are also working towards developing auto-lease models taking car rental services to another level. Recently, Toyota launched a service in Tokyo that allows customers to lease Lexus cars at a fixed rental along with the facility to replace their car once in six months. The US car leasing market has really picked up in the last 5 years manifesting a growth of 1.6%.With offerings like these, major automobile companies are looking to utilize unused inventory by moving towards a subscription model. In addition to opening doors of their business to a new set of customers, this can also be seen as a lateral expansion to cope with the shrink in the conventional market.How Can Car Companies Connect with End-users?Automotive companies have traditionally not been involved in providing end-user technology to track fleet or execute a subscription model. Therefore, car companies can explore two avenuesA. Collaborate with Car Rentals and AggregatorsAs car rentals and car-sharing continue to increase in demand with new offerings tailored for different markets, car manufacturers can tie up with them to provide inventory at lower rates to boost demand. While this will definitely utilize inventory immediately, this model might not be scalable across all markets easily.B. Build a Direct Relationship Car manufacturers have an ardent following across all age groups and do not have an awareness challenge. Therefore they can easily unlock revenue by implementing plug n play technology solutions like CarGain which allows them to update and distribute their fleet across different markets gaining better control and visibility of demand across markets both for short-term and long-term rentals.Takeaways The automobile industry is currently undergoing major revolutions at both the supply as well as the demand side. While self-driving cars and electric auto variants are posing new challenges and giving fierce competition to market players, the shifts in ownership patterns are also not easy to adapt to. The winds of change have already surfaced and automakers will have to strive hard to surf the rising waves. In view of this, technological awareness and readiness may just prove to be a game changer for survival in this scenario.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px;"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/rashika-kumar.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Rasika Kumar\n\nVice President – Account Management\n\nRateGain\n\nRasika leads the account management group for the travel business at RateGain.

65632858a3f6fc78b8eba260,-1010403866,Delivering Duty of Care in the Age of Corporate Rogue Travel,"August 21, 2019","Travel Management Companies (TMCs) came into existence to help large corporations, streamline, operationalize and seamlessly manage corporate travel process. A TMC can negotiate the best rates for a corporation, handle procurement, the right itinerary, freeing up employee’s time to focus on their core responsibilities i.e. to focus only on their work and realizing the objective of their travel.Centralized travel booking also means higher visibility to the corporate, helping with the responsibility of duty of care, also helping create key efficiencies and savings.TMCs are also tasked with the important assignment for risk assessments and providing support in real-time. This is a critical part of ‘duty of care’, the moral and/or legal obligation of corporates to ensure the safety or well-being of their employees.Rogue Travel: Trends, Causes and Implications While the idea of letting the experts take care of travel management is ideal, the reality is far from perfect. Rogue Corporate Travel, where employees make bookings outside their company’s chosen travel management system, is common:Why does this happen? Flexibility, convenience and price are the dominant factors. Some employees want better accommodation, some prefer the easier process, some are lured by loyalty points. According to Phocuswright,  “many travelers who book outside of their policy believe they are saving their company money by shopping for better deals.” (The Business Traveler, 2016)” With millennials accounting for a majority of corporate travelers, the violation numbers are increasing. The reason millennials bypass TMCs range from a yearning for experience-based travel to having the flexibility of adding a few days of fun to top off a business trip a trend termed as “bleisure” i.e. blurring the line between business and leisure.A 2017 survey by Business Travel News cited  “the lack of quality shopping and booking tools for business travel, the desire for more convenient travel choices, an easier expense process and a nagging desire for better work-life balance” as the reasons corporate travelers go rogue.The impact of these violations on TMCs is severe. According to Travel Weekly, “Unaccounted-for travel bookings mean the (TMC) won’t be able to take advantage of its full buying power when negotiating with suppliers, which could affect the company’s performance regarding contractual share or volume commitments.” If the number of rogue corporate travelers keeps rising, a TMC’s business travel operational model and position in the corporate ecosystem may be misunderstood, resulting in a lack of transparency in the system.Price of Non-compliance Lower rates and greater convenience of the non-corporate booking platforms hide a huge hidden cost, that of the company not fulfilling its duty of care, the implications of which many employees may not even realize. It is up to the corporates to focus on ‘duty of care’ in their risk management plan and travel policy.When liability begins and ends harks back to the definition of duty of care. To fulfill their duty of care, corporates are expected to provide consolidated information on travel itineraries, particularly for high-risk destinations, issue alerts regarding events and disruptions, ensure traveler profiles — including emergency numbers and health records — are current, track employees based on ticketed itineraries and provide support, including itinerary change, advice and emergency response.Out of policy bookings reduce the visibility of companies, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to discharge ‘duty of care’. Depending on the law of the land, this can result in costly measures against the company. Its brand and perception might also be dented for good.Companies without a realistic duty of care policy, and effective travel risk management program are sitting on a ticking time-bomb. It’s not a matter of if they will need it, but when.Duty of care has a positive rub-off too. Employees work better if the TMC appointed by employer simplifies travel processes and keeps them from dealing with nuisances of travel management on their own.Improving Compliance and Discharging Duty of Care Compliance increases if travel policy is designed around what employees want. Often companies are more concerned with optimizing expenditure than traveler satisfaction. Enhancing employee experience starting right from the moment of booking till their return is crucial to improving compliance, which in turn improves the discharge of ‘duty of care’.Communication is just as important to meet business traveler expectations. Complete the feedback loop — listen to the experiences of the traveler, understand the reasons they go rogue and implement remedial measures to make the journey from enforcer to enabler.You can also expand your range of onboard partners to ensure that the most suitable airlines and hotels are covered, and your TMC or online booking channels offer the prices that corporate travelers get elsewhere. Offering a variety of appropriate options will give your employees a choice to crave and encourage them to remain within policy. Automated travel approval technology can make it easier for travelers to make the right decisions.But all these steps are redundant if the rates are not correct either in the online booking system and or not available at the time of booking. Corporates should regularly audit their TMCs to ensure accurate negotiated rates and completeness of data on the travel portal, which will inevitably lead to higher compliance. This is where RateGain comes in.RateGain is playing a critical role by helping world-leaders in TMCs to be on top of negotiated rates, ensuring that they meet their goals, deliver on their brand promise and duty of care, leading to higher corporate customer travel satisfaction.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Melissa-Jones.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Melissa Jones\n\n Associate Vice President\n\nRateGain\n\nMelissa Jones, the business development pricipal leading RateGain in the Travel Management Company segment is an experienced SAAS Sales Executive with 15+ years of expertise of working in the industry.

65632859a3f6fc78b8eba262,1039094538,Who is winning the experience game in travel and hospitality?,"July 22, 2019","The travel and hospitality industry is in the middle of a digital disruption. With convenience as their primary consideration, customers are going digital to book everything from in-flight meals to guided tours, and to provide them the best possible experience, companies are turning to technological solutions.The tour operator-OTA-vacation rental rivalry for the customer’s heart is playing out against this backdrop. If OTAs have moved a step ahead of the others in flight and hotel bookings, hotels in many geographies are struggling to maintain their lead over vacation rentals. Tour operators, once the only option for the traveler, may have lost ground but are the best equipped to provide all hospitality services under one roof. Whoever wins the customer experience game will win this three-way contest.The importance of customer experience is not unique to travel and hospitality. Enterprises across industries are recognizing the critical importance of delivering an experience that sets them apart from their competition. The number might have gone up even higher since then. Circa 2019, customer experience is the factor that can make or break a brand.Trump Card: TechnologyBusiness and leisure travelers both want an experience customized for them. Travel and hospitality players have no option other than next-generation tools like big data analytics, machine learning and AI to offer customization and personalization at scale.The process starts with the right offer at the right price at the right time. With the right technology solution, this is not too tall an ask. Thousands of companies from across the industry have benefited from RateGain’s rate intelligence, price optimization, electronic distribution and brand engagement solutions that leverage the latest digital and cloud-based technologies.A principal reason for the dominance of large OTAs, besides the large transaction volumes and customer bases, is their ability to leverage data to gain business insights and offer value-added services. For example, when a customer books an airline ticket through an OTA, the platform will recommend booking on certain dates for discounted prices or suggest a hotel for the destination being booked. Apart from providing useful recommendations, OTAs also incentivize repeat business by offering customers targeted promotions based on past behavior.Analytics is also being used to shape experiences according to the needs of individual travelers. Travel apps now translate languages in real time, offer live updates on flights and help find last-minute hotel deals. Premier Inn in the UK has been using The Hub Hotel, an augmented reality wall map that gives guests extra information about places of interest when they look at it through a smartphone or tablet. The use cases of technology solutions in travel and hospitality are limited only by imagination.The Customer Experience playbookPersonalization of results and suggestions is one of the factors influencing the popularity of OTAs, something that the top tour operators are trying to emulate.Despite their success, OTAs can do more to improve the overall customer experience and are thus attempting to break the perception that they only sell airline tickets and hotel discounts, and offer customers a seamless, 360-degree experience.Tour operators are in the best position to offer to the widest range of travel and hospitality services but to provide the best experience they need to step up their technology game quickly. Multiple surveys show that the number of tour operators and package providers are declining in the US.For starters, tour operators can harness the power of social media and web chat interfaces to build brand recall, and chatbots to offer improved customer support. In terms of customer experience, the chief advantage is rapid response time. A customer can get his question answered even in the middle of the night. Tour operators also have a strong human connect through their vast network of travel agents which a pure play tech provider like the OTAs don’t have. So the tour operators should technologically equip their travel agents to get access to customer data and product offerings to offer relevant personalized offers and make bookings, modifications quickly.OTAs and Vacation Rentals have stolen a march over tour operators in this regard. US-based vacation rental company RedAwning turned to Amazon Connect to deploy Scarlett, a virtual assistant with AI, using automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech features to ‘converse’ with callers. Scarlett has reduced call wait times, enabled faster resolutions of issues and decreased the call load for human agents. Research indicates that the global cloud-based contact center market is expected to grow from US$6.80 billion in 2017 to US$20.93 billion by 2022.Like chatbots and contact centers, Internet of Things (IoT) is adding to convenience and comfort. Using IoT, devices can be configured to automatically detect and respond to conditions in real-time, regulating temperature and light. The technology even helps property managers schedule preventive maintenance.Connecting with airline APIs that allow customers to look up flights and add-ons from multiple carriers using an intuitive interface is another avenue OTAs are exploring to offer improved services. When customers use APIs to specify their preferences for flights and ancillary services, the total cost shows up in the search results and aids buying decisions.The verdict on who will win this three-way contest will not be out immediately and might not even feature these players in the near future, however any player trying to master the experience game should learn from the playbook of these three segments to build the right data framework that can adapt to the traveler’s changing expectations.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepak-Aneja.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Deepak Aneja\n\nEVP – Delivering solutions for Business Needs in Travel Domain,RateGain\n\nLeading Teams for product management, deliveries and operations of Travel vertical for products PG-OTA (RateShopping/NetReports), PG-Car, PG-Air and PG-Cruise",https://rategain.com/blog/who-is-winning-the-experience-game-in-travel-and-hospitality/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Who-is-winning-the-experience-game-in-travel-and-hospitality-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Who-is-winning-the-experience-game-in-travel-and-hospitality-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepak-Aneja.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Artificial Intelligence (AI),Internet of Things (IoT),Travel Technology,,,,,0
6563285aa3f6fc78b8eba264,-443071530,Airlines: Soaring on Ancillary Revenue,"July 18, 2019","Ancillary revenue is what stands between profit and loss in the airline industry. Rising operational cost and competition have made non-ticket revenue the differentiator among airlines. For some of them, revenue from retail has already surpassed that from ticket sales. The top 10 airlines worldwide in terms of ancillary revenue have increased their collection under this head from $2.1bn to $29.7bn in the 10 years to 2017, according to IdeaWorksCompany (IWC) and CarTrawler. The two companies predicted that the airline ancillary revenue globally would grow to $92.9 billion in 2018. McKinsey estimates ancillary revenues at $50 billion to $55 billion a year (without counting the revenue from frequent flier programs), which exceeds the industry’s $31 billion 10-year average annual operating profit. Whatever your chosen index, there is no disputing the critical importance of ancillary revenue in the overall health of an airline. Eye on Ancillary Three-fifths of $5.8 billion ancillary revenue of United Airlines, which topped the IWC and CarTrawler ranking, came from “a la carte” sources, such as extra baggage charges and travel retail commissions. The frequent-flier program accounted for the rest of the amount. United is not alone. Airlines across the globe are trying out various programs to make ancillary revenue count even more. If Etihad has announced an auction for passengers to upgrade cabin class, Ryanair aims to be the Amazon of travel. Whether ultra low cost, low cost or full service, every airline worth its ATF wants to maximize its ancillary revenue and gain a competitive advantage.In the evolving vision of the leading airlines, a flier’s purchase of a ticket is only the start. The hotel room, rental car, guided tour, and even the evening entertainment must be booked through the airline’s gateway. Eventually, shopping too will be a bigger part of the mix, extending well beyond in-flight sales from a limited catalog. As Ryanair’s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs told Financial Times, it is about “using data to cross- and up-sell the products you already have to the customers you already have.”For most airlines, the flexibility of choice that the unbundling of fares unlocks for customers is an added justification for ancillary revenue on top of the financial imperative.The Way Forward Disruptive technologies such as big data analytics, AI, robotics and augmented reality that help airlines overcome operational issues, enhance upselling and minimize revenue leakage play are the key to increasing ancillary revenue as well. The role of frontline employees is also important because they are ones responsible for selling or delivering most ancillaries.For the growth of ancillary revenue, airlines must identify the right resources, provide them with the right tools and support, and align processes and structures. Even steps that seem simple, such as introduction of mobile terminals for collecting in-flight payment and visual dashboards, can go a long way in significantly increasing ancillary revenue for airlines.Some of the areas that need to be tapped are:Merchandising Intelligence: Airlines need to use data analytics and machine-learning models that add value to the services they offer. AI provides a structured, agile and data-driven approach essential for Merchandising Intelligence. The application of data and analytics must be aimed at defining how to sell a product at a reasonable cost at the right time and using the right channel.Ancillary price optimization: Machine-learning algorithms can evaluate purchasing probability in a given context. Armed with analytics-driven insights, airlines can set and vary its prices for ancillaries. AI can then be used to identify the most significant variables that impact customer purchasing behavior.Trip engineering and personalized services: Given the importance of ancillary revenue, airlines should create digital marketing platforms and utilize big data analytics through mobile apps, e-commerce, and automated business processes such as web check-ins to improve revenue growth in these areas.AI-driven chatbots: Using chatbots for proactive communication during the whole customer journey can be the next strategic step. Using combinations of AI-run chatbots and customer support, an airline can offer a whole array of services, including upgrade options, vouchers/ offers and preferred taxi service booking, on the customer’s chosen messaging app.Feedback analysis: Airlines can use AI to zero in on pain points in the airport and flight experience through feedback data analysis and market research and come up with targeted ancillary offerings that enhance flier satisfaction and increase revenue. Creative campaigns for engagement: Innovative social media campaigns can improve brand loyalty and recall. Because most passengers book tickets online or on their mobiles, airlines must look at dynamic packaging to boost their ancillary revenue. AI and IoT elevates personalized service to the next level.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shikha-chadhha-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Shikha ChadhaVice President – Product Management\n\nRateGain\n\nLeading Product Management Group and driving Engineering/DevOps team with a vision of creating most innovative price intelligence and revenue management products in airline technology.",https://rategain.com/blog/airlines-soaring-on-ancillary-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Airlines-Soaring-on-Ancillary-Revenue.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Airlines-Soaring-on-Ancillary-Revenue.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shikha-chadhha-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,AI,Ancillary revenue,Chatbots,Merchandising Intelligence,,,,0
6563285ba3f6fc78b8eba266,-1496318845,Transaction Tracking and Analytics: Steering Car Rental,"June 24, 2019","The travel and transportation industry has historically been slow to innovate. Many players in the industry, especially car-rental companies, rely on customer service and employee loyalty, rather than digital tools, to generate business value.Technological disruption is shifting the ground beneath their feet. App-based operators have already put technology at the center of the car-rental industry and increased the competition drastically. Now analytics is in the process of upending the market. Today, data holds the key to higher revenue and lower cost in car rental. Moreover, data can mitigate risks and drive customer satisfaction.Thanks to the boom in the number of connected vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT), and other digital tools that log transactions, there is no dearth of data related to car rental. This means that companies must rely on analytics not just for business growth but for survival.In this time of churn, the companies have to choose the right analytics tool to reduce doubt and forecast the future. Knowing the whereabouts and status of their vehicles is no longer enough. Opportunities to make operations efficient, save costs and maximize revenue are far more important for car rentals.What drives profitThe following factors can affect the bottomline of car-rental companies:The volume of rental transactions is determined by corporate and leisure travel. These can be linked to the volume of air travel.Depending on the performance of the economy, these volumes and rates might go up or down, but the competitive pricing pressures will remain a permanent feature of the industry.A slowdown in the economy at home or abroad can affect the revenue flow of a car-rental company. These fluctuations make it imperative for companies to optimize operations and rental rates to cope with pressure from competitors.In an industry with many variables — managing inventory, tracking fleet, keeping a tab on customers, and so on — optimization of rates and operations depends on optimization of data. This is where analytics can generate tremendous value.More and more automotive businesses have started using analytics along with cloud computing to derive a range of benefits, from making operations more efficient to identifying the right collaborators. Hertz, for example, has automated data gathering and analysis across the world to improve customer satisfaction and retention. Avis uses data to understand the customer better and come up with customized strategies.What can analytics doThe right analytics solution must provide car-rental companies meaningful insights in a simple and intuitive manner so that they can boost their pricing and planning capabilities. The solution should help companies deal with dynamic changes easily. Accurate transaction tracking can help car rentals simplify operations and identify problem areas. The end goal is to enhance productivity and customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.Our product, CarGain, makes accurate forecasts after analyzing all possible rental transaction data, using the power of next-generation technology like machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It tracks bookings multiple times a day and comes up with the reasons behind every spike, and provides insights on transactions triggered by events, weather, holidays and airline capacity. The results are presented through an easy-to-use dashboard that helps car rental managers and revenue analysts track every transaction easily.We have incorporated customer feedback into CarGain to provide more control to the user, and transparency to set up reports, map locations as well as get a better view of daily statistics.ConclusionIn a market where multiple companies have the same set of cars to offer on rent, how many, at what price and when could be the difference between success and failure. Harnessing machine learning and AI, data analytics can provide price intelligence that is simple, efficient and streamlined. It is the ignition that starts your company’s journey to the future.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anup.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Anup DhirajAssociate Vice President – Product Management, RateGain\n\nLeading Product Management Group and driving Engineering/DevOps team with a vision of creating most innovative price intelligence and revenue management products in travel technology.

6563285da3f6fc78b8eba268,-853331822,Enhancing Car Rental Revenue Management with AI-driven Dynamic Pricing,"June 24, 2019","The car rental industry today is enjoying a boom amid rising disposable incomes, improved air connectivity across smaller cities, and healthy growth in business and leisure travel. The U.S. market had its best year ever in terms of revenue in 2018, clocking a 4.8% jump in top line to over $30bn. Even more impressive was the fact this record revenue was realized on smaller fleet base, with revenue per unit hitting an all-time high of $1,131 per month.While the above tailwinds are expected to continue over the near term, the industry cannot afford complacency – particularly with regard to revenue management and price optimization. The highly dynamic and competitive nature of the complex marketplace makes it imperative for operators look beyond historical trends for fine-tuning their demand, price and yield management strategy.AI insights for dynamic pricingConventionally, car rental companies set prices and business rules by deploying large teams who carried out time-consuming, exhaustive manual analysis to anticipate the fees customers will pay for products and services. However, with on-demand, personalized, omni-channel consumption exploding in the digital age, and unprecedented volumes of customer data being generated at various sources, this legacy method is no longer optimal.This is where the industry must leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to attain dynamic pricing, and boost revenue per unit, average rates and utilization. AI can seamlessly factor in numerous variables–including location, seasonality, real-time demand, individual buying patterns, competitors’ pricing and time of day–to match demand and supply, and uncover evolving demand patterns. Other factors the algorithm considers include inventory availability and in-house historical sales data.For example, AI can figure out if a given car attracts higher demand in a locality–at a specific time of the day–and trigger surge pricing without impacting other vehicle segments. Moreover, self-learning algorithms can configure such patterns for one car segment and one car out of thousands of combinations.Another unique feature of dynamic pricing algorithms driven by machine learning and other cognitive technologies is that it can also project the likely responsiveness of individual clients to special offers. AI does this by mining the different data patterns associated with a buyer, spanning multiple sources such as postal codes and loyalty cards, and assessing the marketplace conditions.That’s not all–dynamic pricing enabled by AI can help operators simulate different price ranges to test if buyers would opt for newer vehicle models instead of older ones. Another use case can be to test the potential efficacy of a planned promotion, and change the pricing to maximize adoption.Overall, car rental revenue management with AI-based dynamic pricing does not depend on sub-scalable approaches like linear programming and traditional pricing rules, but learns from data to refine decision making continuously. Conclusion For revenue managers like you, AI is not a threat but a major enabler that can help you become more productive. Look at this disruptive technology as the next chapter in the evolution of rental pricing. Unlike in the past where you had to pitch rates to many stakeholders and key in new prices, today you can use AI to enhance price prediction and optimization.\n\nIn short, AI offers a significant opportunity for you to target each of your customers strategically at the right moment in their buying journey, and deliver a streamlined, on-demand experience.About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anup.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Anup DhirajAssociate Vice President – Product Management, RateGain\n\nLeading Product Management Group and driving Engineering/DevOps team with a vision of creating most innovative price intelligence and revenue management products in travel technology.",https://rategain.com/blog/enhancing-car-rental-revenue-management-with-ai-driven-dynamic-pricing/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/car1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/car1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anup.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,AI,Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,0
6563285ea3f6fc78b8eba26a,-1427764987,Busting a billion-dollar digital myth for cruise lines!,"February 8, 2019","Cruise brands have an enviable position: with strong brand equity, a loyal customer base and a superior product, they enjoy massive profitability in the so-called Golden Age for Cruise Lines.Among the three largest operators worldwide, Carnival earns $31,181 per minute, while Royal Caribbean takes in $16,165 and NCL books $9,273.Buoyed by massive superships that command a premium, operating profit has nearly doubled in the past four years.With each new vessel, the industry manages to absorb the new inventory without having to reduce prices or sail with lower-than-desired occupancy. Cruise lines have expertly navigated these waters, welcoming a record 27.2 million passengers in 2018.Even so, there’s some choppy water on the horizon. With each new supership – and the show-stopping new features geared towards the “wow” factor – the industry dates itself. Existing ships seem a little less shiny and a little less new.This leaves older ships with a marketing dilemma:Cruise lines must find a way to maintain existing business while developing new revenue streams in parallel.The reliance on physical space for revenue means that taking that physical space out of service for upgrades and redesigns presents a significant business risk. And you can hardly renovate floor-by-floor while still welcoming guests, like a hotel.To deliver a successful digital transformation, cruise lines must expand revenue streams on existing ships by upgrading technology and the passenger experience, all without pulling ships from service.Table of ContentsBusting the billion-dollar myth of a costly digital transformationCruise lines are diving head first into digital transformation. Major brands like MSC Cruises and Royal Caribbean have committed billion-dollar budgets to transform into digital-first organizations.From a digital concierge, mobile apps for guests, and full-ship wifi, to crafting immersive virtual reality experiences, the leading brands now differentiate the guest experience through digital initiatives.These initiatives have redefined the booking process, made marketing more personalized, streamlined the boarding process, and made it much easier for cruises to engage with passengers during and after the trip by capturing real-time feedback.Royal Caribbean is taking on this challenge by transforming the once “off the grid” cruise vacation into a connected, tech-enabled experience, according to Forrester.As the cruise boom continues into 2019, digital transformation is definitely the need of the hour for cruise liners as it will help them in delivering better customer experience leading to an increase in revenue.Given the obvious complexity, digital transformations can be intimidating. Most cruise lines have been reluctant to invest too heavily in digital, making certain assumption about how digital fits into the physical experience of a cruise ship. Let’s bust these myths!Myth #1: My loyal fan base means that I don’t need to consistently attract new customersTo expand the cruise audience to match the growth in new ships, brands must prioritize marketing to the next-generation of cruisers. Small, targeted campaigns can affordably drive significant revenue from new segments.For new cruisers, the marketing must first convince them to take a cruise. Only once that decision is made does ship selection come into play. Marketers should make a series of small bets to entice new cruisers.To make these bets, RateGain helps cruise lines leverage historical data, as well as provide future forecasts from events and weather, to help revenue managers make better predictions and identify demand from untapped markets to target new audiences.As mobile search increases, cruises need to be positioned correctly across all channels, while also managing their reviews to attract audiences.As per RateGain’s data science lab, more than 50% of people read reviews on Google before making a decision on which travel company to choose. For a more premium priced product like cruises, these reviews really matter.Cruises should also create the right forum for customers to share their experiences on social media, as this word-of-mouth marketing from cruise loyalists is free and immensely powerful marketing.By tracking social media feedback through products like RateGain’s BrandGain, cruises can encourage passionate cruisers to share their experiences and expose new segments to the pleasures of cruising.Myth #2: Digital transformation must be a multi-year overhaulWhile it’s true that the most effective and long-lasting digital transformations require a company-wide effort, there are small projects that any cruise brand can implement relatively quickly.One example is part of Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation. To help cruisers choose excursions, as well as entice reluctant cruisers to purchase an on-board excursion, the company has set up immersive virtual reality experiences. These “try before you buy” experiences are also available via its mobile app.For functions such as revenue, social media marketing, rate shopping, guest reputation, and data intelligence projects, new technology and processes can be implemented within anywhere from a week to within one year.It all comes down to prioritizing specific outcomes, matching the technology to the objective, creating a realistic timetable for roll-out.Myth #3: Emerging technologies are still not relevant for cruisesCruises have a powerful ally when it comes to the utility of machine learning and New Age data.Across the cruise operation, there are many points where capturing and analyzing large sets of data can deliver an improved passenger experience, as well as a more profitable operation overall through reduced costs and increased efficiency.For example, Royal Caribbean already uses artificial intelligence to suggest schedules and events personalized based on passengers’ disclosed preferences.This type of application is an efficient and impactful way to deploy emerging technology to achieve a specific outcome: in this case, a more personalized guest experience which translates into greater satisfaction and more potential on-board revenues.The ideal approach is to avoid getting overwhelmed by the big picture and overspending on futuristic-but-unproven technology. Successful digital transformations solve daily challenges that help companies make faster and more accurate decisions.Myth #4: Smaller cruise lines cannot match up to digital efforts of major cruise linesSmaller brands are well-positioned to thrive In the digital space. With a more intimate connection with cruisers, small brands can bring a personal touch that sets them apart.When it comes to technology, it’s about translating this personalized approach into the right digital tools. Smaller cruise lines can work with SaaS partners to automate and transform their middle and back-office operations.These improvements increase staff productivity and reduce customer acquisition costs through better intelligence, rate distribution, and reputation management.Another example of an achievable digital effort is rate intelligence for cruises.By tracking competitor rates through tools like RateGain Rate Shopping, cruises can map each ship to craft apples-to-apples product comparisons that help refine pricing strategy.For these projects, look for straightforward implementations that require less upfront effort yet deliver out-sized results.Myth #5: Digital for cruise require substantial infrastructure upgradeWith the advent of cloud computing, most data now is stored in a data lake. This centralized source substantially reduces cost and time to market, especially for digital initiatives that focus on increasing efficiency of marketing and pre-trip communications.The time and cost savings free up smaller teams to focus on specific audiences and channels to squeeze more demand from smaller marketing budgets.It all comes down to prioritizing the technologies that deliver impact in the short-term, which then fuels greater long-term investment as revenues grow, costs drop, and guest satisfaction rises.RateGain’s own data lake for cruises has data from cruise lines all across the world consisting of historical competitive prices, events, weather which cruise lines can leverage to build applications on top of the data lake for faster insights.The first steps in a digital transformationNow that we’ve busted a few myths, here are the first steps to take when starting on the digital transformation journey:1. Identify bottlenecks : Qualify the key pain point/performance indicator you want to improve for your cruise line between attracting demand, customer experience, and overall operations, and then break down the program into smaller projects2. Know your cruiser : Prioritize external data that influences your customer in the decision making journey. Targeted marketing with personalized offers ensures a higher conversion on marketing spend.Knowing what customer is searching for and their preferences and then targeting them with relevant offers and promotions will help in getting higher RoI on marketing spend.Capture the passion of cruise loyalists with strong loyalty programs that use data and analytics to target repeat cruisers with relevant offers at frequent intervals3. Identify digital opportunities: Don’t rule out the need for new technologies to improve processes and get better intelligence, such as targeting customers with relevant on-board offers during pre-boarding.Capture, store and analyze customer on-board data and connect it with pre-board data to create micro-segments and finding segment level patterns. Insights from segmentation can inform better product design.4. Leverage your data: Use New Age data for better forecasting, planning, marketing, and pricing. By merging historical booking and pricing data, along with holidays, weather, competition, you get accurate forecasts to set optimal rates.Choose a data partner with cruise expertise, like RateGain, to track competition and respond quickly with appropriate measures.5. Focus on flexibility and scalability: Look at a multi-vendor setup with the natural choice for specific departments being SaaS-based quickly implementable solutions.And don’t forget social: having the right social media software for cruises ensures that customers are able tag and post their pictures and write about their positive experience in social media.Claim Free Consultation\n\n(first published in Phocuswire: https://www.phocuswire.com/Cruise-billion-dollar-myth)About the Author<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-23224 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0-3-150x150.jpg"" alt="""" width=""105"" height=""105"" />Apurva ChamariaChief Revenue Officer –  RateGainApurva Chamaria is the Chief Revenue Officer of RateGain.

65632861a3f6fc78b8eba26e,2026216257,"‘A Thousand Words’: Why Great Visuals Speak Directly, Fluently and Effortlessly","August 27, 2018","A Management Review Tool is an essential component of a Hotelier’s toolkit. With the evolution of online reviews, on-site plugins and social media, hoteliers have to constantly look at the big picture – who is talking about the brand? Where and what are they saying? From dedicated review sites to Meta Search platforms, the answer is multi-faceted and constantly changing.Capture visitor sentiment accurately, with feature-rich review toolsTextual reviews have traditionally been the standard, coupled with ratings, recommendations, and other parameters. Now, with aggregators like TripAdvisor offering picture reviews or even video reviews from HolidayIQ, review management tools must transform and incorporate these modules.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-20404"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog_review.jpg"" alt=""Picture Reviews "" width=""563"" height=""324"" />Picture reviews as seen on TripAdvisor & ExpediaSource: Tripadvisor.com and Expedia.comThe importance of quality reviews cannot be overstated. 53% users will not book a hotel unless it has sufficient reviews, TripAdvisor reports, and if hoteliers respond to 65% of them, a hotel’s rating rises to an average of 4 stars. An effective model for ensuring return customers, as well as informing and attracting new prospects, is by providing users myriad ways to evaluate their hospitality experience and share feedback.This makes built-in picture reviews support and powerful response mechanisms, critical for modern hotel & hospitality ORM teams.ORM’s role and picture reviews simply cannot be ignoredTypically, the ORM market impacts 80% of a hotel’s workforce and functionalities. Based on the brand’s repute, stakeholders would define marketing campaigns, allocate budgets, hire employees, expand presence, and so on. However, with new channels for reviewing and insights-dissemination emerging every day, hoteliers are faced with a complex task – how do we achieve an end-to-end view of customer chatter? And how do we respond effectively, across formats, platforms, languages, and locations?Modern review management tools leverage state-of-the-art technology to address these requirements. Data from multiple sources are collated, passed through a semantic engine that ‘reads’ the entire review, analyzed according to KPIs like service or value-for-money, and finally, a response is elicited.However, review management tools often don’t factor in the features available on the original review platform. Google Reviews, for instance, has supported images for a while now. Yet, the same content would appear without the embedded pictures when viewed from most review management solutions. Social sites like Instagram, Pinterest, and Foursquare have been popular sources for travel inspiration for a while now and require the utmost attention from hoteliers. However, marketing executives lack adequate visibility, and must constantly cross-check with the source-site to ensure their response is in alignment with the visitor’s original comment.The process, then, becomes tedious, protracted, and frequently, error-prone.5 Reasons Why Images are Key to Revenue Generation:1.Customers can easily weed out fake reviews, giving the hotel more credibility-With each platform showcasing hundreds of reviews, readers are likely to skip one-liners and generic commentary. Picture reviews add authenticity to visitor experiences, encouraging others to seek out the same. Hoteliers that acknowledge these reviews further ratify the veracity of the experience, reassuring new prospects.2.Imagery and graphical presentation is central to F&B marketing-When it comes to restaurants and fine dining, a picture has always been worth a thousand words. Aesthetically pleasing F&B imagery helps promote in-house F&B services/outlets and intelligent responses, here, can also boost customer loyalty.Imagine great service, captured in a photograph that accurately recreates the experience for a prospective customer. How dishes are plated, carts or trolleys used for live services, or even ‘food theatre’ where recipes are finished at the table, could land a destination on a tourist’s must-visit list.3.Customer images that mirror pictures shared by the hotel are likely to drive bookings-Pictures shared from the hotel’s own brand handle could be viewed as biased or strategically placed. While there are several ways these could be made more attractive (like opting for natural light, avoiding distorted perspectives, and showcasing nearby landmarks) customer-shared images remain invaluable.These are perceived as realistic and essentially, objective, adding credibility to service excellence, cleanliness across public areas, and the quality of essentials such as bathrooms or laundry facilities. Further, reviews featuring elements that closely resemble hotel images could positively impact Brand Image, increasing reservation numbers.4.Unique features, like infinity pools, outdoor views, and in-house facilities, can give you an edge-In a hypercompetitive hospitality landscape, amenities that offer a competitive advantage need to be featured prominently. Popular business locations, for instance, will have 10s of hotels, operating largely at the same price-point. Reviews focused on distinctive features and validated by a response from the hotel, could bring an all-important edge.5.The first impression is, generally, the last impression-While browsing, images are far more likely to capture and hold attention than textual content. This makes a negatively positioned picture, even when accompanied by neutral-sounding text, more compelling than a positive text-only review. And with the advent of innovative image-sharing channels, like Instagram’s ‘Moments’ which are accessible for just 24 hours and Foursquare-able ‘Pins’ to preserve great finds, the landscape is continually evolving. Hoteliers who cannot access images directly from their review management platform, risk understanding this feedback only partially.Select a Robust and Progressive Management Review Tool At the end of the day, the task of a review management tool is to make hoteliers’ lives easier, without requiring them to scan through every channel, multiple meta search engines, and various social media sites for mentions and comments. Today, social media presents a hive of formats, shareable graphics, and channels. Instagram’s ‘Boomerang’ feature is a popular standard, and live videos – on Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat – add a dynamic quality, ensuring more views.Without a platform that allows pictures to be embedded in-app, executives have to switch between interfaces – a counterintuitive and time-consuming responsibility.With imagery and multi-media feedback more popular than ever before, and readers starting to lose attention after a mere 8 seconds, ORM products have to deliver comprehensive solutions. This would include translation support, direct response without leaving the interface, auto-response for common use-cases and detailed analytics.<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-20403 "" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-768x186.jpg"" alt=""picture reviews"" width=""796"" height=""192"" />Picture reviews supported on BrandGain, RateGain’s Online Reputation Management SolutionThere you have it; remember, the discerning global traveller uses a plethora of tools, accesses multiple platforms, and works with a complex mix of vendors to discover the best travel experience. Great images are then an indispensable value-add for the hotelier, adding flesh-and-blood to their customer ‘attraction, retention, and loyalty’ game-plan.",https://rategain.com/blog/importance-picture-reviews-hotel-reputation/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-brandgain-1200x600.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-brandgain-1200x600.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog_review.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-768x186.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632863a3f6fc78b8eba270,369356408,New Age Data is Driving Growth for Travel Package Providers,"August 24, 2018","With the advancement of digital technology, travelers are now leaving their digital footprint at multiple touch points, right from researching about possible destination for next vacation, to searching and making a booking, going for the trip and sharing feedback about the travel and stay.Cloud Technology today allows package providers to capture and store new age data like Social Reputation, Search, Events, Weather, Airline Capacity, News, Promotion, Booking, etc. at real-time basis.Big Data Technology for travel package providers allows them to analyze this new age data and generate actionable insights like competition price change, demand forecast, price recommendation, etc. to take automated decisions like price change, promotion, offer, etc. at a real time basis.The challenge for package providers is to architect and implement the end to end ecosystem for leveraging the maximum benefit of the new age data and also to drive a culture of data driven decision making.Table of ContentsHow to find the Right Data and use it effectively?Travel related Data volume is growing exponentially and data itself is getting obsolete at a much faster rate than before with the advent of live streaming data. So it’s critical for package providers to set the right data strategy by leveraging cloud & machine learning technology for being able to capture, store, analyze, generate insights and make necessary changes at scale and in real-time.How to find Micro Trends and use it effectively?Package providers need to capture and store the data at multiple levels of granularity of geography, time window, customer level, etc. In terms of geography it could be at a country, city, district, street and at an individual property level. Similarly, in terms of time window, it could be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. This will help in finding localized micro trends at various levels which can then be used to run personalized campaigns.For example, most of Europe is experiencing very hot summer in 2018, which is impacting the overall demand for summer vacation to destinations especially in southern Europe. If a travel package provider captures and analyzes historical weather, events, holidays, market pricing and booking data at a destination level, it will be able to predict easily the impact of weather on its business. Now if the package provider tracks the weather forecast, it can easily forecast future demand and for periods of soft demand it can proactively take measures like running promotion, focusing on high demand market, etc.Another example, would be cases where a travel package provider tracks Social Reputation data and uses insights from this data for contracting with the right set of hotels and ranking the right set of hotels in their listing page.Related Search Query : Travel Package Price ManagementHowever, accessing, processing, and utilizing new age data poses several complexities, and addressing these would be key to leveraging its full potential.3 Common Roadblocks towards using New Age Data effectively1.Finding the Right Data-Technology Partner:It’s really critical for package providers to partner with the right data-technology provider as all the new age data will not be available with package provider themselves and they need to find the right partner who can provide the right quality data, consistently and can provide it in a way than can be easily ingested into the package providers own technology platform. Also package provider should try and find a partner that can support them with all the external data requirements rather than engaging with multiple data providers.2.Integration support to enable swift action:It is really important to set up the right technology system in-house that can integrate with all the new age data and provide competitive advantage in the market place by analyzing data faster and churning out insights speedily that can also be actioned upon quickly.3. Challenge of organizational change:This is the most critical in the long run – the challenge of organizational change management and getting everyone aligned to work together, share data and insights and taking decisions based on data insights.A dedicated, flexible and easy-to-deploy solution could help make sense of all the data out there, increasing Revenue Opportunities.Providers are strengthening Package Optimization Models – and SNEW can helpTravel packages are now more targeted and customer-specific than ever before, and it is all possible because of access to the right data. Consider the case of Red Roof Inn, a US-based hotel chain that uncovered a link between weather data (a particularly severe winter in 2013-14) and a 3% increase in airline cancellation rate. This meant, around 90,000 travellers were stranded every day around major US airports.Red Roof Inn launched a targeted marketing content, pushing content to mobile device users in the affected areas – and saw a 10% uptick in numbers.Accurate forecasting can significantly impact the success of the promotion/discount campaigns. Package providers who’re unable to respond to dynamic market movements, stand to lose out on emerging opportunities that are eventually overtaken by competition.There are two sides to this optimization – peer-specific data should ensure prices are kept at an optimal level; this could be called passive data utilization. And destination-specific data, like weather or geopolitical shifts, could be used to create new plans and packages – this would be proactive data utilization.Finally, using New Age data to forecast future needs would bolster decision-making and add credibility in a changing and often-volatile market.Imagine a scenario where a provider strategizes prices specifically in-line with a prevalent trend. Competitors without access to this data generally lower the prices dramatically to boost sales. However, the data-led provider stands their ground – once the market shifts and demand increases, as predicted, they stand to make a windfall. By then, the competition has already wasted their inventory on low-priced sales.New Age data-based forecasting technology will redefine how providers create and promote their packages, leveraging the power of multi-source information to take the right plan, at the best rates, to the ideal traveller demographic.About the AuthorNanak BanerjeeVice President – Product Management, RateGainNanak is an Engineer & MBA with more than 13 years of work experience in consulting, analytics, product management.

6563286ba3f6fc78b8eba276,1909405072,Code Itineraries: A road map for the travel industry to unlock one trillion dollars in value by 2025,"April 11, 2018","Today’s travelers have easy and complete access to all the information they need: TripAdvisor tells them best places to go to, their friends post photographs and reviews on Facebook, and an OTA tells them the best combination of flights, hotels and rental cars they should consider. All brought together into one seamless experience on their smart phone. Travel companies by contrast, have far less information than this when understanding their customers and deciding on their go to market strategy.Every cloud though, has a silver lining. The same digital disruption that has given the traveler leverage, is also giving something significant back to the Travel businesses: Data. Every search, review, booking, complaint, swipe, “like,” buy, comment produces a unique virtual identity – something we will refer to as a “code itinerary™,” which can be harnessed to understand a traveler’s persona and intent. This is powerful information in the hands of Travel companies who know they can only win by rewriting the rules of engagement with digitally savvy travelers. Not surprisingly, digital transformation has become a top priority in this industry, and according to World Economic Forum 2017, done right, has the potential to unlock $1 trillion of value for the industry by 2025. To get there, Travel companies need to focus on the following strategies.Digitize or bustDigitization as a technological innovation for Travel companies however, is just an enabler. True digitization that unlocks the “Trillion dollars in value” requires much more. It needs for a Travel company to bring about organizational changes to meet the needs of the digital world. As a first step it is important to raise the digital IQ in Travel companies. It means breaking down silos so that Marketing and Revenue Management are working hand in hand to meet the needs of the traveler. It means both Marketing and Operations working together to address the negative tweet from your guest. In other words, a complete alignment with the traveler who sees a Travel company as single brand, embracing an innovative mindset and creating a culture that is able to stay ahead of the digital traveler.This is easier said than done. Culture and mindset changes are hard. While no employee will argue about aligning with a digital strategy, a legitimate question to address would be about legacy applications and processes that cannot be abandoned overnight. Travel companies will have to create roadmaps appropriate to their business. Perhaps start with getting all your data together in one place and then adopt the next-generation analytics. Or upgrade your revenue management solution with a dynamic one without affecting the upstream and downstream processes. Identify quick wins that will engender faith in employees. But most importantly, get employee buy in, provide training where necessary and hire the right talent to thrive in this exciting digital future.Travel companies need a sense of urgency as they contemplate their digital journey and they will do well to pay heed to what Clayton M. Christensen says in his book The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. In it he argues that disruptive innovation usually starts at first in a small niche of an industry which established firms would typically ignore. But this disruption gradually matures, solutions that work in the niche area improve enough to start working with the mainstream, and suddenly established firms are disrupted or displaced. Airbnb is a case in point. Started as a home rental portal, they now are disrupting Expedia and Booking Holidays by offering themselves as a distribution channel for independent and boutique hotels on their site with a compelling commercial offer. How much longer do you think before the major hotels also start distributing their inventory on Airbnb?For Travel companies the disruption is not just from new entrants or nimble competition, but also from the connected traveler who might take his business elsewhere. The hour is upon Travel organizations to start on this digital journey now – before the disruption wave becomes a tsunami. Early movers, with a clear understanding of Code Itineraries, stand to win a piece of the Trillion dollar prize!",https://rategain.com/blog/code-itineraries-road-map-travel-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/code_itinerary1-534x267.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/code_itinerary1-534x267.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Data science,,,,,,,0
6563286ea3f6fc78b8eba278,1039642929,5 Ways to Improve Your Hotel's Visibility within Search Engines,"April 9, 2018","Today, when a customer wants to find a hotel, they will often search for options online, using a search engine like Google, or Bing. Indeed, Google’s search engine is a particularly useful tool for this purpose, because in many cases it will also display reviews, room rates, availability and location information as well. For hotel owners, it pays for their hotel’s website and any associated online content to be as visible as possible when people search for terms related to it.The best way to ensure this is through a search engine optimisation (SEO) strategy, so that the hotel ranks higher on Google and Bing’s search engine results pages.What is Search Engine Optimisation?\n\nSearch Engine Optimisation, or SEO for short, is a practice used by online marketers to improve hotel’s visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs). The results that are displayed on search engines like Google and Bing are ranked according to complex algorithms, and SEO seeks to optimise website content so that the website is ranked highly.Ultimately, the higher up a website ranks in search engine results pages, the more chance it has of attracting traffic. In fact, research from Search Engine Watch shows that the typical user will not even click onto the second page of a SERP, which is why hotels need to aim to be as high up on page one as possible.With that in mind, here are five tips to improve hotel’s visibility:Design Your Site With Users In Mind\n\nGoogle’s algorithms like well-designed websites, which are structured properly, where pages link together and where users do not ‘bounce’ off the site quickly. For this reason, it is critical that you evaluate your website from the perspective of a user and focus on making your site as user-friendly as possible.Pages should load quickly and every page should be a viable landing page. Additionally, with more search traffic now originating from mobiles than from desktops, mobile optimisation is absolutely essential.Embrace the ‘Content is King’ Mantra\n\nRegardless of the other SEO practices you adopt, your efforts are destined to fail if you do not focus on producing fresh content on a regular basis, in order to keep users coming back. After all, Google prioritises websites which generate consistently high traffic and the best way to ensure this is to offer something new.A blog connected to your website is the ideal way to add fresh content regularly, target specific keywords and share important news with visitors. Crucially, however, the content needs to be high-quality and useful to readers.Optimise For Local Search Results\n\nOver the past few years, Google and other search engines like it have placed a focus on local results, especially due to the popularity of mobile. For this reason, it is beneficial to optimise your site to attract local as well as global hits. There are several basic steps to follow for this.Create a Google My Business Page and add your hotel to online directories. Format your contact details in the same way on all of these sites, and include those details on your main website too, along with a map.Develop a Link-Building Strategy\n\nGoogle’s algorithms prioritise’high authority’ websites and one of the ways the search engine ascertains authority is by checking both incoming and outgoing links. This is why many SEO experts speak about the benefits of developing a good link-building strategy.Try to include high-authority (Websites with a lot of traffic with the same topic) external links within some of your content and try to encourage other sites to link to your website in their content. Often, affiliate programmes are the best method for thisDirect Traffic Towards Your Website\n\nFinally, a very simple step to improve SERP placement is to encourage as many people to visit your website as possible, by actively promoting it. Your web address should be clearly displayed on all social media platforms and you should also use Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to share individual posts or pieces of content.Join hotel directories, platforms like Google+ and Google Places, and clearly print your web address on any physical leaflets or literature that you hand out, so that you can get as many hits as possible from interested people.Google Reviews Are Becoming More Important for your Search Engine Ranking.Over the past few years, Google has given increased importance to customer reviews, and recent updates to the platform’s algorithms have ensured that these reviews now play a more crucial role in SEO than ever. As a result, hotels looking to boost their visibility on SERPs need to try to generate as many positive reviews as they can.Customer reviews are especially important for local search results, because they are a major determining factor in which hotels are displayed. At present, Google displays a small number of the most relevant local results for users and reviews are one of the top factors taken into consideration when deciding on relevance.The reviews that are taken into account include those left on your Google My Business page, but also those left on external review platforms, such as Yelp, Trustpilot and Trip Advisor. Moreover, the most recent Google update now also checks for star ratings left through plug-ins on your own website.When attempting to improve your SEO results, it is important to try to get customers to leave reviews and it is also important to try and ensure these reviews are positive. However, it is absolutely critical that you do not resort to manipulating reviews, as Google has sophisticated techniques for identifying and penalizing fake reviews. With a powerful Hotel Online Reputation Management tool, you can easily track what your guests are saying and leverage the information accordingly.Therefore, the only real way to generate positive reviews reliably, in a way which will not hurt your search engine results placement, is to provide a consistently excellent level of customer service. Then, you need to take the time to ask satisfied customers to leave reviews on the aforementioned platforms.As an added bonus, an accumulative star rating from your reviews will be displayed next to your website on search engine results pages. Multiple studies have also shown that websites with a 4 or 5-star rating on Google’s SERPs generate more clicks, on average, than websites that do not have any reviews at all, because they inspire trust.For more practical revenue & marketing tips about how to grow your hotel business, please have a look at the free guide of Revfine.com.Guests AuthorMr. Martijn BartenMartijn Barten has over 10 years of experience in developing, implementing and managing revenue management processes and strategies for individual properties and multi-properties.

Introducing Distribution Strategy Studio,"January 11, 2018","Distribution Strategy Studio is the first of a series of events organized by RateGain during 2018, exploring news and trends in travel distribution and revenue management. The first leg of this exciting itinerant journey  (which will include cities and Countries all over the globe as Dubai, Milan, Colombia, Delhi, Mexico, Berlin and many more), will be in Madrid on the 16th of January, just the day before the opening of FITUR. Latest trends in Online Distribution and Revenue Management will be the event fil-rouge, with panelists from companies like Xotels, HotelsCombined, Wanup, MM-One, Simone Puorto Consulting and (of course) RateGain giving their point of views on what’s hot in the Industry.Table of ContentsCommon Revenue Management mistakes to avoidThe event will start at 3:00 p.m., in the suggestive location of the TRYP Madrid Atocha Hotel. After the registration, Alejandro Gómez Losada, Director of Sales at RateGain, will open the day with an intriguing speech titled Common Hotel Revenue leakages and how to tap them. During his presentation, he will explain how the travel marketplace is constantly reshaping itself and will provide precious insights and suggestions on how to increase your property revenue. If you want to find out what is the effect of rate disparity on direct bookings, how to individuate your indirect comp set, how to track and leverage events and holidays in your pricing strategy and learn about the best way to analyze market supply and average rate, then you will definitely enjoy his presentation.Brand consistency is the new SEOAfter Alejandro, it will be my turn to give tips on how to stay competitive in our ever-changing industry. My speech will focus on the importance of brand consistency and will introduce concepts such as vertical search, micro-moments and multiple touchpoints, analyzing how the booking journey has evolved over the years and providing concrete pieces of advice and best practices to hoteliers. Are you tired of OTAs, metasearch engines and video platforms brandjacking you? If the answer is yes, I have some interesting things to tell you.Rock ‘n’ Roll Robot“Smart data allows for intelligent decisions and better results” said Yann Fruchart, VP Global Business Development Xotels and it’s one of the best quotes I have ever read about distribution. The scientific approach to revenue management and online distribution is the title of his presentation and he will be discussing the impact of Artificial Intelligence on revenue management, with a revolutionary 4-step system approach (price grid, algorithms, human intervention and machine learning). Yann will guide you through the whole decision process in order to create a successful and consistent rate strategy, analyzing property capacity, demand level and comp set.This is metasearch’s worldMetasearch traffic has tripled since 2014: excellent acquisitions, IPOs and technological advances ensured metasearch advertising a privileged place in every hotel marketing strategy. But the scenario is changing rapidly and being listed with just rates may not be enough anymore. Irene Herrera, market manager of HotelsCombined.com, will talk about personalization and how the current online customer is getting savvier on metasearch. Either you are already using these platforms to advertise your property or you are considering it, this speech will give you precious insights.There’s nothing cheap about loyaltyLoyalty programs seem to be a hot topic in 2018. Just last week I wrote an extensive article about how the mattress-run-model is basically dead and loyalty needs to rethink itself. Rosa Montero, CCO  at Wanup, will update you on what is new in the loyalty landscape and the importance of having a loyalty strategy for independent hotels as well. Reducing your distribution costs, increase direct bookings and recurring stays are just a few of the pros of having a solid loyalty program. What do frequent travelers want when they stay in a hotel? Why do they select a certain property over another? What makes them stay at the same hotel over and over? If you are curious to find out, do not miss her speech.Yo, Johnny! I see you in the next life!MM-One has a surprise for you: to keep the adrenaline high you will not know the name of the speaker until the day he/she delivers the presentation. I had the pleasure to read it in advance and I loved the comparison they make between online travelers and surfers. A few years ago I wrote a short free e-book titled “Point Break”, as an homage to one of my favourite 90’s movies ever and I used the same parallelism, so this struck a personal cord with me. Why “surfers” travel? Do they already know where they want to go or not? Who is the average surfer? How can hotels improve the surf experience for their guests? I am sure you will enjoy this speech as much as I did because, as Bodhi used to say, it’s “100% pure adrenaline!”So basically you have no excuse: a free event, six cool panelists and (most importantly) free coffee.  See you in Madrid!  Guests AuthorMr. Simone PuortoSimone Puorto is a digital analyst, published author, public speaker, founder and CEO of Simone Puorto Consulting. His main area of expertise is hotel web marketing and his articles have been published in magazines and blogs such as Social Media Today, Travel Daily News and Social Media. He has been working in the hospitality since 1999 and he managed two hotels in Rome, Italy.

65632874a3f6fc78b8eba27c,1927608568,Your Hotel Reputation Matters to Your Revenue,"December 11, 2017","Earlier in hospitality domain, the pricing structures and decisions were majorly based on factors like supply and demand, local events, corporate/negotiated rates, event/group bookings, majorly because of the absence of hospitality technology tools. With the advent of hotel price intelligence tools, competitor rates became an important factor in pricing. However, in the current scenario, the focus is shifting to guest reviews and ratings. Now, the price that you can charge for your room is directly proportional to your hotel reputation, specifically online reputation.Reputation Management touches the property as a whole and needs to be the responsibility of every department in the hotel working together. ORM should go hand in hand with Revenue Management. Your hotel reputation should also guide you to use reviews to influence your decision-making process and effect change where required.Hence, Online Reputation Management is immensely important for hotels and travel companies because customer reviews have a direct correlation with demand and hence pricing, which is the holy grail of revenue management.Working on your online reputation, reviews and rating includes improving guest satisfaction by enhancing operational effectiveness and efficiency and remembering all this pays off monetarily. As a smart strategy, hotels should make sure that the time and efforts invested in ORM improve their direct bookings, ADR and RevPar. Hence, by improving your hotel reputation and sharing the outcome with all other consumers, both revenue and guest perception improve.A recent study from the Cornell School of Hotel Administration has also further established this finding, that guest satisfaction has a direct impact on the commercial performance of the hotels.The study says that an increase of 1 point in the hotel’s review scores leads to an increase of 0.89% in price (ADR), a 0.54 % increase in occupancy, and a 1.42% increase in Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). The research also verifies that the influence is across all distribution channels, whether online or offline.Another research by a reputable organization has established that a positive online hotel reputation has the power to demand higher prices on online platforms.One of our esteemed customers Mr. Vishal Kamat, Director Kamats Group of Hotels and CEO (Fort Jadhavgadh) agrees to this finding that the positive sentiment of online reviews diminishes the impact of price on the consumer purchase decision. This implies that higher number of positive reviews influence a traveller to pay more for your property whereas bad reviews will discourage bookings, even if your property is at discounted rates.This finding simply suggests that hotels need to focus on guest satisfaction, guest review and ratings as they make pricing decisions for their hotelSimple and Easy Tips to Manage your Online Hotel ReputationRemember the nature of social media is such that your response will never go away hence be careful of what you post.For more information on how to manage your Online Hotel Reputation, please read our guide – What to look for in a modern Online Reputation Management ToolIt is advisable to have a designated team to handle your online hotel reputation management. However, in the absence of a team, it is okay to have a group of people involved. Nevertheless, always have a leader who can make decisions and set guidelines for managing your reputation.To conclude do not fixate over return on investment immediately. Online Reputation Management is not always going to be a direct revenue opportunity. Sometimes the payback might come two years down the road when a guest satisfied with your response makes another direct booking at your hotel.Therefore, hoteliers stay focused on improving your service quality and returns will certainly come.",https://rategain.com/blog/hotel-reputation-matters-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Reputation-Management-147765833-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Reputation-Management-147765833-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,,0
65632877a3f6fc78b8eba27e,783679980,"Hoteliers, Take a Re-look at Parity and Prevent Revenue Leakages","November 23, 2017","You may be the smartest revenue managers with the expertise in revenue management and pricing strategies. You may have a sizeable stock of inventory to play with and you may have access to an umpteen number of online channels to reach your consumer. Nevertheless, certainly, this is not enough to ensure high RevPAR and ADR.Despite having all checks and systems in place your hotel’s bottom line can suffer because of revenue leakages, which usually go unnoticed. Hence, we need to understand these hitches in detail.What are revenue leakages?Revenue leakages occur when certain actions lead to loss of revenue, eventually leading to a decline in your planned revenue. To explain it in simple language assume you fix the price of your rooms and estimating your revenue based on it, but if one or more of your distribution channels sell it at a lower price, you face Rate Disparity accompanied by Revenue Leakages. With the increased popularity of online booking channels, the complexities of distributing your inventory have also increased. Hence, offer more chances of revenue leakages. Industries with perishable product and services like travel and hospitality frequently face this challenge.Following are some common grounds of revenue leakages:While you cannot eradicate all of them, you must focus on the major ones because controlling them will substantially lift your bottom line.OTAs —Friend or Foe?Hotels and Online Travel Agents are interdependent on each other. While hotels have always fancied getting rid of the high commissions they have to shell out for the online bookings OTAs get them, they do not want to miss the market penetration, reach and promotional paybacks OTAs provide them. No doubt, OTA popularity, and enormous customer reach remain unmatched to that of any big hotel’s online presence. However, OTAs often undercut hoteliers, making them a major contributor to hotel revenue leakages.Let us look at some statistics from Triptease–Such a situation demands a need to check this practice, which is possible by knowing where disparity stems from.Following are some common reasons for the OTAs causing rate disparity:Although this may look like a huge list of reasons for leakages, it has a solution. Check Rate Parity.What is Rate Parity?An ideal situation when room rates on the hotel brand site all of its distribution channels are same you attain rate parity. If working well, it makes revenue management much easier, maintains price integrity and boosts revenue by avoiding leakages.However, unlike in the pre-internet era, when hoteliers could easily engage in price discrimination without their customers having any clue about it, hotels now need to engage rate parity tools to ensure there is no parity breach. Only then, they can assure the learned and aware customers of today that no matter what is the booking medium they will get the same price. This way hotels will be able to save their brand integrity and revenue losses.Increased practice of online distribution has shifted the pricing strategy of hotels in a new direction. There are no longer any individual markets that are priced according to the needs of the consumers in that market. Now, there are global customers wishing to book via the online medium at the lowest available price.  Hence, arose the necessity for a consistent pricing across all the channels.Stiff competition in the pricing has lead the hotel to thin their rates. Because of the internet, giving birth to the price transparency, it has lead hotels to compete solely on the price. There are primarily three reasons for the prices to be so dynamic. Foremost, travellers are more educated now, as the information is easily available to them.How to ensure Rate Parity?What all progressive hotels need today is a powerful rate parity strategy and a tool that helps them drive in more direct bookings, manage parity across regions and platforms, keep a check on campaigns, discounts, and promotions and control fare violations or revenue leakages.The list below can help you manage this:<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-14754"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rateparity_banner4-768x346a.png"" alt=""hotel revenue leakages"" width=""661"" height=""298"" />Put Rate Parity at work for youThe idea behind keeping a check rate parity is to ensure that other distribution channels do not undercut your brand website; it puts restrictions on hotels also to drive in more potential revenue. Looking at the flip side, rate parity agreements can help you with more revenue generating opportunities:For the hotels to be profitable, they need to have more profit yielding bookings. However, if the OTA commission keeps rising, it becomes difficult. Also with the current equation of  OTAs taking the whole control of Metasearch and customers becoming more keen to find the cheapest rate until the last moment, changes to rate parity are required.To conclude, hotels need to drive rate parity towards value differentiation than just price. With this article, we want to emphasize on the progress towards the Best Value Guarantee instead of Best Price Guarantee. Yet, a little attention on the key troublemakers can go a long way in warranting that, your hotel always stays ahead of the competition.

6563287aa3f6fc78b8eba280,19975551,Building the Perfect Revenue Strategy Is Not Enough; Advanced Hotel Revenue Management Tool is a Must!,"November 13, 2017","Hotel Revenue management is a data-driven technique consisting of three interdependent components: customer, product, and price. In order to maximize the hotel revenue in the hospitality sector, it is important to sell the right space at the right price and at the right time. This is the selling mantra of the hospitality sector.The four ingredients of the recipe to maximize revenue are Segmentation, Forecasting, Pricing, Distribution.The traditional hotel revenue management model that was in practice until a few years ago focused only on keeping the maximum number of rooms occupied by the guests. With developments in technology and customer behavior now, the focus has shifted to demand-based pricing or dynamic pricing. This concept has moved to not just hotels but also other hospitality establishments also like amusement parks, theatre, etc. and across travel sectors like airlines, cruises, car rental, etc. They charge a surged price for the tickets during peak hours or high demand. This helps them ensure more profit when the demands are high and cover up for the losses during low demand.A revenue manager must take many factors into consideration, such as changes in consumer buying behavior, the roles of various online distribution channels, and the activities of the competitive set.A modern revenue manager’s job now is not limited to monitoring room rates, it has stretched beyond this extending to revenue strategy to analyze all available data to determine the tactics that will produce the greatest revenue and optimize room inventory.We are now at a stage where big data is quickly generated and collected. Additionally, data has become increasingly sophisticated in terms of variety, volume, and type. But while revenue management relies on huge piles of data, data alone is not enough.Revenue managers also need to churn that data and provide required insights and actions to be taken.For profitability to increase in the hospitality sector, forecasting the demand much ahead is really important. Next, gather competition price intelligence; advance level price intelligence tools support tracking price based on geography, booking device and member-only rates. Then set the price of the rooms in the hotel accordingly.You also need to consider the fact that products like a hotel room and a flight ticket are perishable items, which means that if they are not sold within a stipulated time period, they lose their usefulness and any profitability that will come from them. If a room remains unoccupied for a night, the revenue for that night is lost.Therefore, it is utmost important that the price of the room or flight tickets etc. is set dynamically based on real-time updates from market and competition behavior.Guest segmentation is one of the key factors that are at the core of hotel revenue management. From marketing and sales to loyalty management, the segmentation approach lets you support all these efforts.Segmentation of guests based on their demography, geographic placement, privileged membership status and the device they have used for booking the hotel, makes it possible to target them better for price sensitivity. Segmentation of the guests is also done on the basis of the purpose of the travel, like business or leisure. Business travelers have different requirements as compared to leisure travelers. There is a rise of a new segment also called “Bleisure”, making it challenging for hotels to meet the expectation of this category of travelers. This segment majorly includes Millennials.A hotel room tariff is fixed based on different factors, including the advance reservation period of the hotels as well as the price charged by the competitors, etc. Length of Stay (LoS) or the duration of the guests’ stay is also an important factor that affects the price decision by revenue managers.Apart from this, hoteliers are increasingly focusing on ways to increase revenue from guests while they stay on your property. For example, the hotels are devising strategies like enhancing their revenue by encouraging the guests to utilize services like spa, clubs, games, business conference rooms, restaurants, and other activities in the hotel premise. A smart and holistic revenue management approach takes into account every service that the hotel offers in addition to the room and also the auxiliary revenue streams that contribute to the profits. All these assets contribute largely to the overall revenue of the hotel from each guest.The revenue management of a hotel is no longer possible by estimating all the factors in an unplanned manner. Current market dynamics need the accuracy of data and real-time insights and hence new generation and advanced revenue management solutions are now increasingly used to help the hoteliers understand the market pattern, anticipate the demand and regulate the price accordingly.From the ROI perspective, it is imperative that a hotel business relies on a robust and automated revenue management system for all daily mundane manual jobs.An efficient and a cutting-edge Hotel Revenue Management Solution not only increase the revenue and profitability, but also ups the efficiency of sales and marketing efforts. This directly leads to improvement of market insight, demography of the guests and current trends in the occupancy of the hotel inventory. In this day and age, where competition is quite intense in the hospitality sector and the customer very demanding, it is the time that you must manage your revenue smartly to ensure success.Guests ContributionLiveBean Hospitality\n\nFounded in 2007, LiveBean is a leading hospitality consulting firm marked by dynamism and constant innovation and specializes in providing the hospitality, leisure, tourism & real estate industry with solutions geared towards service excellence and growth of shareholders profitability.

6563287da3f6fc78b8eba282,-156602712,Travel Industry is Already Using Geo-based Competitive Price Tracking; Act Now Before Its Too Late,"November 3, 2017","Location Based Price Tracking; a Key Feature to Look Out For in a Rate Intelligence ToolWith advances in travel technology tools and travellers being more aware, the hotel industry has grown to become a highly competitive domain to cater to the needs of this new generation of travellers. This has led to extreme volatility too in its operations. In such a scenario, a key challenge faced by the hotels is how to sell their entire inventory and at the best possible price at all times in order to grow and maximize revenues, i.e. ensure high ADR & RevPAR.This means that revenue managers have to rely on a lot of industry insights and competition data that could give accurate information about the pricing trends prevailing in the industry, besides analyzing the market forces and the day-to-day impact that it could have on the pricing strategy.Undoubtedly, data is the key driving force that helps tech-savvy revenue managers take the right pricing and other decisions for their hotel, which empowers them to stay ahead or at least at par with the competitors. The availability of a highly advanced rate intelligence tool has put the process of manual rate shopping and data accumulation to an end. Technology tools employ the best-in-class technology to bring the in-depth competitive price intelligence on to the table of revenue managers in a simple, easy-to-consume and understandable format.Geo-based pricing | Dynamic Pricing Based on LocationDynamic Pricing is not a term that is unheard of in the present era of hospitality by revenue managers. In fact, it is one of the most frequented concepts in the hotel industry. Especially as we witness market forces in the industry fluctuating every now and then, even by the hours, hence requiring the room prices to be revised quite frequently, maybe many times a day.However, what is important to note here is that the concept of dynamic pricing has also widened enough with time and market dynamics. It now takes into account multiple other factors that impact room pricing, which perhaps was not taken into consideration earlier.Well, hotels have now started to delve down deep into the behavior of their competition like tracking their pricing strategy in different geographies, different modes of booking and different traveller personas.Moreover, with OTAs playing an extremely significant role nowadays in online travel booking space, the accommodation providers have started to implement differential pricing strategy for targeting customers booking from everywhere. Like smart hoteliers and OTAs are tracking prices for the same property and same travel period using different approaches like – tracking prices of bookings originating based on their location (geography based price tracking) for the same hotel, based on the device used for booking (mobile or laptop) and membership status (close user group users/non-members) of the travellersWe will discuss more about Geo-based price tracking in the article.To understand it better, let us assume a hypothetical situation- Two friends Jack and Tom are planning a vacation in Mauritius. Jack, resides in U.S. and Tom in Australia. Both wish to book a particular hotel in Mauritius on a given date through a particular well-known OTA, say on TripAdvisor.Now, there are chances that these two travellers might see an entirely different price for the same hotel for the same travel date, which results in them paying a different amount for the same type of room (obviously, in a different currency) to complete their booking. Jack pays 120$per night and Tom pays 135 $per night.Well, do not be surprised! Point of Sale (POS) based pricing is the new trend in travel and hospitality. Not only travel industry, e-commerce industry is also using concept for pricing.Geo-location prices of different hotels are being taken into account by industry players both hotels and OTAs as it gives them a sense of how competition is pricing their property in different regions and then, accordingly set (or change) their own prices.What kind of a rate intelligence tool does a hotel need to price its rooms based on the location it is booked from?Not all hotels and OTAs in the industry are aware of this extremely advanced pricing technique. Selected few technology vendors are offering this feature in their tool for competitive price tracking, which could place a hotel and an OTA a few steps ahead of others in their comp-set.Of course, the understanding seems to be at a pretty nascent stage in the industry as of now, so is the availability of the feature as part of the rate intelligence tool.Kudos to the remarkable technology improvements over the past few years that has made it possible for the hotels to receive the wealth of information for location-based competitive pricing knowledge at their fingertips with the help of a superior rate intelligence tool.To gain superior understanding of the pricing strategy of the competitors, it is important to know their pricing strategy for different markets. This information could greatly help revenue managers optimize their own hotel’s pricing strategy. Hence, prevent any revenue leakages that might happen from the lack of this information.A superlative rate intelligence tool, by tracking multiple data sources, produces dynamic competitor pricing reports, which enables hoteliers to react in real-time to the changing prices.Therefore, it is advisable to go for a comprehensive and advanced solution based on your requirements and devise the perfect price strategy for your hotel!",https://rategain.com/blog/geo-based-competitive-price-tracking-rate-intelligence-tool/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Geo-pricing-764x382.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Geo-pricing-764x382.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Price intelligence,Rate shopping,,,,,,0
65632880a3f6fc78b8eba284,2018704031,We Bet You Will Not Want to Miss The Benefits of a Comprehensive Hotel Price Intelligence Solution!,"October 25, 2017","Pricing has always been an important aspect of any business as it plays a quintessential role in the effective running of all industries worldwide. Hotel price management, i.e., how the goods and services of any business are priced and tagged in the extremely competitive market scenario goes a long way in determining the firm’s profitability in the long run.The hotel industry is a perfect example of the application of dynamic pricing in diverse market situations to ensure that each room is booked at the right price to the right guest, ultimately yielding profits and numbers for the hotel.Well, multiple factors like the rise of online booking trend, the emergence of multiple channels for booking, cut-throat competition in the hospitality industry and rapidly fluctuating demand patterns has made it almost impossible for the hotel players to closely monitor the industry, competition rates, and trends manually on a day-to-day basis and accordingly make changes to their own pricing structure. Doing that would mean revenue managers totally immersed in the function of pricing, leaving no room for performing other roles.Moreover, since the rates for the hotel rooms are quite prone to rapid changes as they are based on the ever-changing demand and availability of rooms at any particular time and location, developing the most effective pricing for your hotel could sometimes be challenging. With an upswing of all these complexities and the many limitations that manual operations may pose, automation comes to the fore as a strong rescue to the industry at a time when it is needed the most.Data plays a vital role in such a scenario, empowering the hotels to make sound pricing decisions and develop a unique revenue strategy for their property.\n\nUndoubtedly, hotel price intelligence equips the hoteliers with all the necessary market information and supports them with robust and meaningful insights that smarten their functioning by helping them act real-time and intelligently.What is Price Intelligence?Price Intelligence is based on a unique automated mechanism based on intense market data crunching that identifies, analyses and outlines the pricing and revenue related data of the hotel, its competition and the industry at large, demand forecasting based on past trends. Thereby enabling hoteliers to gain a deeper and better understanding of the pricing strategy of competitors, existing trends and changes in the market forces, along with its impact on their own prices.\n\nHaving the wealth of readymade information on competitor prices and industry demand and supply patterns almost instantly facilitates faster and informed decision making for hoteliers.Real-time data, a key component of hotel price intelligence, not only includes key insights on competition rates, but also on the inventory available and various promotional activities being run by other hotels and OTAs. Information about the competitor promotional activities (any discounts, schemes, room offers, special packages, etc.) is utmost important, as it gives hoteliers a three sixty degrees view of the market, thereby highlighting opportunities and misses if any.The lack of such valuable inputs and insights could prove to be hazardous to the revenue numbers; hotels might end up charging more (and have less occupancy) or less from their guests (leaving revenue on the table). The former impedes customer loyalty while the latter would erode the hotel’s profits. In both cases, their growth prospects run a serious risk, a not so desirable situation.A sharp rise in the use of advanced hotel pricing intelligence tools that facilitate optimized hotel room pricing has emerged as a key trend in the recent past for reasons that need no further mention.However, it is important to understand the nature and requirements of your hotel and choose the best technology to reap the best results in the form of benefits. The use of a suitable hotel price intelligence solution would put you on an edge higher by allowing you to price your rooms for optimum occupancy and revenue.Why Employ an Advanced Hotel Price Intelligence Solution?Due to its multiple benefits, already discussed and some of which are listed below, it is advisable to choose the right hotel price intelligence technology that is best suited to your hotel business goals and targets.a) Competition Price Tracking – Without the availability of competitive rate information, success could be a far-sighted affair. The implementation of an efficient hotel Rate Intelligence Solution takes care of this most important aspect, as it brings forth a detailed price report of the key competition/chosen comp-set, which facilitates comparison and therefore helps in effective and optimized pricing.b) Quick decision-making – By offering actionable insights on a real-time basis, the use of hotel RateShopping tool would put you on top of all price developments taking place in the industry and alert you if any instant action is required. By being able to assess the live demand in the market, you could react faster and in a more accurate way – whether it is increasing your rates, lowering them or running any promotional offers, etc.c) Maintain rate parity – As rate parity is a key factor in the pricing strategy of almost all hotels, the availability of real-time data aids in effective distribution by making sure that the rates that you set for your room types across multiple channels are in line with the industry trends and do not highlight a stark difference.d) Make long-term forecasts – Almost all the pricing intelligence tools offer the supreme advantage of long-term forecasting, providing hoteliers an opportunity to optimize their room rates well in advance. The graphical representation of these forecasts is usually easy-to-understand and aids in proper planning.e) Focus on other vital organizational roles – As technology takes over the role of competition and industry rate tracking, revenue managers could spread their wings in multiple directions and take charge of other important functions where their knowledge and expertise would yield fruitful results.f) Revenue Maximization – By being able to sell your room at the best price in any kind of market situation, you are ensuring that you are not missing revenues due to any unforeseen price variations taking place in the market. Over the period, the use of active hotel price intelligence facilitates the fulfillment of revenue maximization goal.The Future\n\nWhile a majority of the big hotel players are already availing the many benefits of using sophisticated price intelligence technology, most of the small players are still comfortable with the conventional way of digging out extensive reports prepared internally using excel sheets or perhaps, by conducting their own research on a small scale manually. However, with technology advancing at an unimaginable speed and putting all the existing processes to rest, one thing is clear – the use of hotel price intelligence tools is not a short-term trend, but a long-term necessity, without the use of which the hotel could suffer various technology and revenue setbacks.The key is to stay alert on the industry pricing trends and the Price Intelligence Technology is just about that!",https://rategain.com/blog/benefits-hotel-price-intelligence-solution/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pricing-764x382.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pricing-764x382.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Price intelligence,Revenue Management,,,,,,0

The hospitality industry is also experiencing this change, gradually adjusting to it and now reaping benefits from it.As the traveller in large numbers took to these tiny devices for booking their travel, hotels worldwide responded to this trend by reinventing their business strategies and resorting to various innovative marketing tactics to tap the mobile hooked traveller.Hotel Revenue Managers have introduced various special schemes with discounted rates and promotions specifically targeted to the smartphone users to encourage mobile bookings via mobile app, which promotes the use of these devices even more. One of the most common ways adopted by the hotels and OTAs is offering discounted rates of up to 10% (or even more) on booking accommodation through their brand mobile app, which works as an absolute delight for the consumers as well.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-13663"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mob_laptop-768x547.jpg"" alt=""mobile app rates"" width=""568"" height=""405"" />Let us take a quick catch up on this evolving trend – the emergence of desktop and laptop bookings gradually took over the role of the traditional travel agent way back, which marked the beginning of a hospitality industry revolution with digitisation taking over majorly. It opened the doors for the traveller to experience an altogether new way of booking travel, bringing leaps of convenience at their fingertips.The next breeze came in with mobile bookings, which offered abundant flexibility to the traveller of indulging in various activities like reviewing hotel properties, comparing rates, booking, etc. anytime, anywhere, on the go. Enabling them to book their travel last minute with mobile apps.Various studies conducted on the subject clearly indicate that hotels are the most prominent sector where smartphone bookings are more common, when it comes to travel, with a recent report pointing out that hotels generated one in five online bookings (mobile) in the second quarter of 2016.SMARTPHONE SHARE OF ONLINE TRAVEL BOOKINGS\n\n(Q2 2016 vs Q2 2015) Furthermore, another finding states, millennial business travellers largely book hotels on their mobile devices, the number having shot up to 52%, according to Skift. Analysing the trends in U.S., a study by HotelsCombined says that hotel bookings on mobile devices increased 67 percent in the U.S. in 2016 compared to the previous year.Bookings on tablets also grew by 30 percent year over year, while desktop bookings increased by only 4 percent – meaning mobile phones have clearly taken over as the preferred search and booking medium and the trend is taking over across borders.Digging into this further, a report by Google highlights the preference of mobile applications for travel-related use, with an average of 2.3 travel apps installed on smartphones. Yet, a higher percentage of travellers (65%) still use mobile sites for travel, as compared to 58% who prefer to use the apps.With more travellers, especially the millennial traveller hooked onto the mobile applications with each passing day, it is important for all in the trade to ride on the trend and adopt an exclusive marketing strategy especially to drive bookings through applications.While formulating the most effective strategy for your hotel, one cannot ignore the set of activities undertaken by your competition in the industry, including the rates that they are offering to the travel community at any given point of time on these mobile apps.Yes, it has become extremely important to monitor Mobile App rates of your competition on a constant basis and thus optimize yours accordingly.

These tools empower hoteliers and OTAs to gain insights into the mobile app rates for your selected competition set thereby enabling you to come up with the best rate and offers for your mobile app. This information is apart from the rate shopping intelligence available for web rates for booking via laptop or desktop.This leaves no doubt about the fact that a hotel tracking the mobile app rates of their comp-set will certainly be much upbeat and ahead in this game compared to everyone else not having this intelligence.Competition tracking has always been one of the essential components to success for any business, and the same holds true for hotels. While the pro-players in the industry are of course using Competition Rate Intelligence for some time now for Web Rates. Competition Intelligence for Mobile App Rates is new to the hoteliers.Having said that, the usage of these apps has not completely surpassed the usage of mobile sites for hotel booking though they have surpassed desktop booking. Expect the world of apps to further adapt in the coming months and come up with more creative solutions which would give a strong push to their usage and change the current numbers.The hotel booking rates via mobile apps might also witness starker variations as compared to desktop bookings or bookings via mobile sites.

65632885a3f6fc78b8eba288,1802870665,Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Intelligence in Revenue Management and Pricing Analysis?,"September 29, 2017","Is it possible that Artificial Intelligence can replace human intelligence in revenue management and pricing analysis? More important to understand here is what it will replace, than a clear “Yes” or “No” to this question.We are sure you must have read about the increasing reach of AI at least a few times recently, in print or digital. Artificial Intelligence is taking over in every business. The time for machine learning has indeed arrived. In almost every industry, machines are taking over. This is irrespective of the fact whether; they will replace or empower revenue management and pricing intelligence.In the travel industry, AI is capable of finding price gaps and demand pattern. In the current time of tough competition, all travel companies, airlines, car rental, and cruises, etc. are looking beyond past trends for price, demand and yield management. Progressive Airlines are already using AI for competitive marketing intelligence, target new customers, build its brand value and drive revenue.Industry professionals are using predictive analytics and interpretations using machine learning. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the biggest trends in the travel industry and other related fields like flight maintenance, airport management, cruise, car rental companies and the hotel industry. Industry players are innovating with their pricing strategy using big data and AI.As we head towards next decade 2020, AI and machine learning will be an even major driver of transformation. However, deficient knowledge of disruptive forces in the business environment is another crucial barrier to correct forecasting related price, demand, and even human resource requirement.While some feel that, the community will witness “The Next Golden Era, as it will radically improve how businesses interact with their customers when they are information assisted. However, what will follow as an outcome of this is getting their staff educated on what AI is all about and how it will enhance their work experience.Another cause of worry for most in the industry is – will it reduce jobs and workforce requirement? Yes, it will. However, for the betterment of the industry. Like in the past also, with the introduction of new disruptive technology many earlier tools, processes, and jobs became redundant. Similarly, AI and AI-based tools will replace jobs just as digital cameras replaced films. While some jobs will disappear, other new jobs will also be created.This is an exciting time to be functioning in the travel business world with so many developments around. In future, Revenue Management and Pricing Intelligence jobs will be the most incredibly transformed by AI and Big Data technologies.Artificial Intelligence coupled with Big Data analytics will permit the automation of many routine tasks, but of course not all of them. Hence, we should only leverage the power of man-machine where human involvement is not necessary. We all will agree, that the travel industry thrives by the personalization and personal touch that you can offer to your guest and this is where humans are required that most. Additionally, there are some logic and understanding that is only possible by a real human brain and not any artificial intelligence.Technology had already begun to share the burden of revenue management analysis and pricing analysis in most repetitive tasks. This was a much-expected change of the explosive increase in available data that we are experiencing from everywhere. Not more than a decade ago, analysts had to work on just a few megabytes of data and they deemed it enough to make decisions.However, things have changed a lot now; your competitors also have access to piles of data. A few hours spent earlier to process small data have now turned into days or weeks. Time spent to this tune will certainly influence your daily schedule; hence, it becomes important to succumb some control of the mundane tasks to the machines.Trusting AI is the best thing to do now. As more data is an enabler to better and more detailed decisions. Moreover, the methods for data analysis are different and more precise. More data means more insights. However, the good part is your workload does not multiply in the same fashion, it rather becomes much easier and data backed.Therefore, it is inevitable that you leverage the power of AI and Big Data analytics to make better decisions and more revenue.The need of the hour is to make a choice here; either you can use the same old methods with the piles of data that you have today you let your competitors take the lead. Or else, adopt AI-empowered methods for data analysis and stay ahead of your competition.While the amount of available data and the ability to process it with AI is growing exponentially, human brain-capacity is limited. It is not possible for any human brain to process this size of data and of course, you have a limitation on the team size. Moreover, you cannot change the pressure you have to face at work. Hence, let us review our initial question “Will AI replace or empower revenue management and pricing analysts?” Yes, certainly, this is very much required need.To summarize, the extent of this change and level of replacement will solely depend on our needs and adaptability to AI. No matter how much you want to resist this change, still some facets of the current revenue management and pricing will indeed be automated sooner than later, however, some others might take a very long time to be automated. As of now, these traits remain more proficient if controlled by humans.One very important factor to be kept in consideration is when we utilize the power of AI tools; the new terrains to improve the revenue management and pricing are limited only by human resourcefulness, experience, and wisdom. AI standalone is not a ticket to more revenue. Hence, that is why we need to plan a correct mix of human and artificial brains. Both have to work as a team to make it work!",https://rategain.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-replace-human-intelligence-revenue-management-pricing-analyst/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Artificial_Intelligence-764x382.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Artificial_Intelligence-764x382.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,,,,,,,,0
65632889a3f6fc78b8eba28a,1006009740,7 Fundamental Hotel Marketing Strategies To Stand Out From Your Competition,"September 21, 2017","What do airlines, tour operator and hotels have in common? All of them sell fixed time-limited resources. Moreover, when it comes to maximizing revenue from a fixed resource, say, hotel rooms, and a permanently fixed price does not help! Let us find out why.\n\nToday, industries like hospitality and tourism face a constantly changing customer landscape, wherein seasonal opportunities like events, contingencies and trends rapidly come and go. Leveraging these opportunities to maximize revenue is only possible with a well-planned yield management strategy.\n\nThis article focuses on how yield management can be a boon to your revenue maximizing pursuits for your hospitality business and help you build the right hotel marketing strategy. First, let us get to the basics!What is Yield Management?Simply put, Hotel Yield Management involves selling the right room to the right customer at the right time. Since competitor price, customer preferences, budgets and demand levels keep changing, a variable hotel pricing strategy also called as dynamic pricing is used to tweak room rates in accordance with the said factors.\n\nConsider a scenario involving an impending festival in your city. Since festivals cause an obvious increase in the group bookings, this would call for a specific strategy to tap the group-booking segment. You can adopt a ‘time-penalty’ approach, which involves a gradual increase in price as the date of the festival nears. This way, while getting more booking volume by encouraging customers to book early, you also get to justify a higher price for bookings made later on and drive additional revenue.How Does it Benefit Hotels?A robust revenue management software can bring a sales uplift of up to 10%, as per a study. Here are some other interesting findings:\n\n• Decrease Errors: Hospitality is an industry that runs on repute. Accurate forecasting decreases pricing errors. This will benefit both your credibility and forecast results and actions. With a yield management process, you foresee changes and promptly act on them, eliminating any miscalculated risks.• Understanding Customer Expectations: Given how dynamic the hotel business environment is, consumers’ tastes keep wavering too. For example, while some hotels seem to utilize a system full of automated services well, others witness an inclination of guests towards an authentic, personal experience. Effective yield management helps you understand customer expectations well and makes it easier for you to cater to the right customers and carry out price changes driven by customer preference.• Effective Segmentation: If you focus on catering to a specific market segment for long, you may be missing on other segments that may be equally or more profitable. Yield management will enable you to understand which areas are untapped and enable you to formulate a plan to tap the same. For example, low prices may be offered to leisure-oriented guests who usually book tickets early, as opposed to corporate guests who show up at short notice periods and can hence be charged more.• Competitive Pricing: When you employ a variable pricing strategy, you eagerly inquire your competitors’ rates and get a better idea of an ideal Average Daily Rate. Following this approach, you can drive more revenue by focusing on profitable bookings, unlike those hotels who may make the mistake of emphasizing booking volume and lose potential revenue.This is just the tip of the iceberg. Yield management can be a great revenue-maximizing machine, if only you learn to do implement it correctly!An Effective Yield Management SystemAlthough formulating an effective revenue management system is never a one-size-fits-all process, you can focus on the following four key practices that throw you into the ballpark.\n\n• Understanding Booking Patterns: Now, on a typical day, your hotel has customers booking at extremely short notice periods, and you have some guests booking in advance by months! How do you get through that? A thorough understanding of buying patterns engenders a well-informed pricing system. Ever observed how airlines use their understanding of booking behavior? You will often notice them adopting a ‘U-shaped’ pricing strategy that starts with high pricing about a month prior to booking, declining subtly in the midway through the month, and then surging to its peak in the week just before the booking. This brings on a rush of sales volume that they use to track demand in such short bursts of time to make better hotel pricing strategies out of it.• Understanding Segment-Specific buying patterns: Buying patterns are segment-specific. For instance, group bookings happen much in advance as compared to individual bookings! Understanding these peculiar differences in buying behaviors is key to crafting custom pricing plans. These may involve, say, raising the prices of group booking packages two weeks prior, to leverage the resulting increase in demand from the said segment.• Understanding Price Change Impact: Yield management does not stop at the pricing stage. Mechanisms for price control must also be in place in scenarios that cause visible price discrimination and such like. To achieve this, your yield manager must calculate the impact of a price change on the demand for a particular type of room and from different segments in advance. In addition, these insights must be made with a robust competitor rate monitoring system, lest the strategy falls flat.• Distribution Channel Management Strategy: Strategic pricing alone helps little if your costs going into channel management remain high. With OTAs taking away a high percentage (as high as 30% in some cases) of a regular booking’s cost, distribution channels are quite a sneaky center of cost. To effectively cultivate the services of your online partners, closely monitor the performance of various distribution channels. This allows you to pull your dollars out of low-performing channels and drive more revenue by emphasizing on high-performing distribution sources. A reliable Channel Management system is indispensable to a reliable Yield Management system.Incorporating the above practices into your business would hinge on a solid Information System, one that involves an integrated and updated central reservation system. The absence of an advanced revenue management tool, would cause errors in forecasts and render the staff unguarded and unaware of accurate room availability figures.Hotels using yield-management practices confirm having gained a sizeable increase in revenue with minimal investment. For this approach to truly work, a yield manager/revenue manager must have a dedicated staff for research and analysis of the required data and a strong tool to provide right insights and actionable. While airlines have been quick to adopt the approach and continue to benefit from it, hotels are also fast catching up.

6563288ca3f6fc78b8eba28c,-1638307258,Design an Effective Hotel Guest Loyalty Program to Increase Hotel Bookings and Revenue,"September 18, 2017","The hospitality industry, like any other industry in this cutthroat competitive era is massively overcrowded, implying that many hotels, big and small, have swarmed the industry in the recent past offering ample choices to the guests, or perhaps spoiling them. A traveller could now easily switch to any property where he wishes to stay in any desired location, basis his/her requirements. For the hotels, in such a scenario, having the same traveller become their loyal customer or even visit their property again becomes an extremely prestigious account. Repeat guests, as they are referred to, are therefore very important for any hotel and there is enough matter to support the same. Research suggests that repeat customers spend an average of 67% more than new customers. Moreover, it also costs five to ten times less for a hotel to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. Hotels across the globe are therefore making enormous efforts to hold on to their existing clientele and develop a list of loyal guests, which they can cater in a special way.Designing a great guest loyalty program has become more important than ever. It is one of the most successful ways to boost your hotel’s repeat business and turn your guests into your brand advocates.While designing a guest loyalty program that works best for your hotel, there are some broad, guiding principles, which if adhered to would ensure maximum results besides a significant improvement in the hotel’s repeat business.a) Know Your Guests Well – Who is your guest? What are his preferences, and what kind of rewards would appeal to each of them individually? These are some of the important questions, the answers to which would allow you to gather maximum information about every guest visiting your property. Therefore, design a guest loyalty program that could even be customized to get the most benefit out of it. By being able to tailor your loyalty offerings, you would be able to give your guests exactly what they want, and therefore deliver value for money and guest satisfaction. This, in turn, strengthens your relationship with the guests and increases the chances of higher retention.b) Make it easy for them to earn rewards – Do not devise a reward program which is stringent or which makes it difficult for the guests to redeem its benefits. The guests, at times, lose their belief and interest in any such program that takes longer to avail its benefit, or perhaps, which has a host of rules and conditions to adhere. The rapidly evolving traveller, especially the millennial traveller, demands instant gratification and do not enjoy the complex structures to avail any loyalty program. Therefore, to make it effective, keep the guest loyalty program simple, easy-to-understand and quick to deliver.c) Promote Engagement with the Guest – You should aim your hotel loyalty program to establish a deep emotional connection with your guest, for which repeated engagement and interactions can prove to be extremely helpful. Offer your guests the rewards for simply updating their personal details at the hotel reception or availing membership of any prestigious group within the hotel. Offering rewards for performing the simplest of activities can go a long way in establishing their trust and commitment towards the brand. An elaborate and extensive reward process would also tickle some excitement for the guest, while also proving beneficial for the hotel, as it gets a fair chance to collect accurate data and drive maximum engagement.d) Ensure maximum value to both parties – Design your program in such a way that it delivers high value to your guest, while also being cost-effective for the hotel. Delivering value to the guest does not necessarily mean offering them monetary discounts, which could actually diminish the value proposition while also being cost-strenuous. Rather, providing them free access to any of the key services, which are otherwise chargeable for all other guests could be the ideal way to go. This would again require knowing your guests comprehensively so that you can offer only those free services to them, which they individually desire and appreciate. The key is to hit the nail right!e) Embrace New Technologies – Chances are that the tech-savvy traveller of today would get more attracted to a loyalty program that is supported by the latest technology. Gone are the days when you would witness any visitor devoting his precious time sitting in the lounge area to view the rewards book or pamphlet, with millions of details packed in it. A program, promoted by the use of this old-fashioned way would hardly have any takers. Therefore, hotels must strive to make excellent use of the recent technology and come up with innovative ways of developing and sharing the reward program with their eligible guests.An online structure to view the program details and fill the guest information is one of the most convenient ways appealing to travellers for long. A mobile app is also a great way to facilitate the smooth execution of the guest loyalty program. Moreover, loyalty cards issued to frequent travellers also work really well, as the hotel could easily track the developments and reward redemption patterns of any particular guest, so that you can devise better ways of customer involvement.f) Make loyalty members feel extra special – Customers are the biggest asset for any business, but repeat customers are definitely the most valuable ones. Making them feel extra special could help the hotel win their loyalty for life. Offer personalized services based on the extensive information about those guests stored in your records. Make efforts to engage with these guests more often through various modes like e-mails, surveys, social media, and blogs, etc.\n\nDelight them by offering benefits that are beyond the normal package. For example, if a hotel is aware that a particular guest likes to visit the hotel’s casino or a spa during each visit, then entice this guest with a free or discount on the entry to the casino or spa. By doing this, you are making sure that the guest is overjoyed, which would make him return to your property.Loyalty programs are definitely a great way for the hotels to make it big and gain a competitive advantage over others. Hence, it is important to design them with due diligence and implement them in the best possible manner so that it becomes one of the top deciding factors for your guests to return to your property.\n\nWhat is important is to keep these programs simple to redeem, meaningful and flexible so that it makes a lot of sense to all the frequent travellers to use it. Moreover, as your list of loyal customers gets bigger with time, you are also enhancing your chances to have a better Net Promoter Score.All the best!",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-hotel-guest-loyalty-program-increase-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Loyalty-Program-145042721-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Loyalty-Program-145042721-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
6563288da3f6fc78b8eba28e,-197595288,Yield Management in Hospitality - Important for Efficient Revenue Management Strategy,"September 14, 2017","What do airlines, tour operator and hotels have in common? All of them sell fixed time-limited resources. Moreover, when it comes to maximizing revenue from a fixed resource, say, hotel rooms, and a permanently fixed price does not help! Let us find out why.\n\nToday, industries like hospitality and tourism face a constantly changing customer landscape, wherein seasonal opportunities like events, contingencies and trends rapidly come and go. Leveraging these opportunities to maximize revenue is only possible with a well-planned yield management strategy.\n\nThis article focuses on how yield management can be a boon to your revenue maximizing pursuits for your hospitality business and help you build the right hotel management strategy. First, let us get to the basics!What is Yield Management?Simply put, Hotel Yield Management involves selling the right room to the right customer at the right time. Since competitor price, customer preferences, budgets and demand levels keep changing, a variable pricing strategy also called as dynamic pricing is used to tweak room rates in accordance with the said factors.\n\nConsider a scenario involving an impending festival in your city. Since festivals cause an obvious increase in the group bookings, this would call for a specific strategy to tap the group-booking segment. You can adopt a ‘time-penalty’ approach, which involves a gradual increase in price as the date of the festival nears. This way, while getting more booking volume by encouraging customers to book early, you also get to justify a higher price for bookings made later on and drive additional revenue.How Does it Benefit Hotels?A robust revenue management system can bring a sales uplift of up to 10%, as per a study. Here are some other interesting findings:\n\n• Decrease Errors: Hospitality is an industry that runs on repute. Accurate forecasting decreases pricing errors. This will benefit both your credibility and forecast results and actions. With a yield management process, you foresee changes and promptly act on them, eliminating any miscalculated risks.• Understanding Customer Expectations: Given how dynamic the hotel business environment is, consumers’ tastes keep wavering too. For example, while some hotels seem to utilize a system full of automated services well, others witness an inclination of guests towards an authentic, personal experience. Effective yield management helps you understand customer expectations well and makes it easier for you to cater to the right customers and carry out price changes driven by customer preference.• Effective Segmentation: If you focus on catering to a specific market segment for long, you may be missing on other segments that may be equally or more profitable. Yield management will enable you to understand which areas are untapped and enable you to formulate a plan to tap the same.

65632890a3f6fc78b8eba290,-571571271,What Makes Your Guests The Promoters of Your Brand?,"September 7, 2017","Are your guests willing to recommend your hotel to a friend, family member or colleague? If yes, then you are probably on the right path. Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a powerful tool used by brands across industries to identify their happy clients (promoters) and the not-so-happy clients (detractors); those who would want their near and dear ones to visit your property based on their pleasant stay, and those who would not. Of course, the activity is beneficial for hotels as it brings forth the areas that need improvement and helps them better their services in future. Moreover, the more the number of promoters, the better it is for the hotel. However, one cannot run away from the fact that there would always be some detractors who would leave your property disgruntled and would not hesitate to leave a negative comment or a low rating for your hotel. The presence of these detractors can pull down the hotel’s overall Net Promoter Score, and prove to be a dampener.\n\nTherefore, in the ideal scenario, minimizing the number of these detractors and increasing the number of promoters is a constant attempt made by all hotels.However, ensuring the same is not a task that can be performed overnight, and requires many processes to be put in place, and a lot of efficiencies to be poured into the system.Remember, we are living in the digital age, where travellers have access to a number of communication channels, especially social media, where they are extremely comfortable in sharing their experience, thereby bringing a huge impact on the hotel reputation. In such a case, having more promoters also increases the hotel’s chances of having better reviews. Below are a few points, by taking care of these a hotel could ensure a maximum number of happy guests.a) In-Room experience – The first and the foremost requirement of any guest that goes a long way in shaping their overall opinion about the hotel is their experience with the room. Factors like room hygiene, comfort, space, complimentary Wi-Fi, clean washroom, etc. play an important role in ensuring that they have a great stay. In fact, a recent research indicates that travellers utilized the in-room features are more than the on-property services. A clear focus on ensuring that the room is well equipped with the right set of things is therefore utmost essential. Clearly, if your guests are happy with the room services, half of your job in turning them into promoters is done.b) Regular Guest Interactions – The journey of making your guest feel comfortable begins as soon as they complete their booking. It is important to hold interactions with them in a friendly manner, even before they arrive at your property. The guests demand constant attention, and the hotel staff must ensure that they make them feel special and valued. Well, in some cases, the guests might not have the requirement to interact with any of the staff members during their entire stay, provided if everything is in place according to their needs. However, the staff’s keenness to interact with the guest and an attitude of offering help for even the pettiest issue ensures a personal touch, which is very important if you wish to have them as a promoter. Various hotels across the world have even introduced robots for customer service. However, the role of human interaction can certainly not be undermined.c) Connect with repeat guests – Repeat guests are your evangelists. Such guests are highly engaged guests and have a high probability of spending more at your hotel. Moreover, they will be more willing to share a positive feedback for your property. You should be regularly engaged with them through special offers and any news about your hotel. Design targeted guest surveys for them, as they are likely to share an honest feedback about your hotel.d) Hotel Location – In which part of the city the hotel is located can very well influence the opinion of travellers. Whether it is centrally located with access to key markets and other attractions (meeting venues in case of business travellers) or is on the outskirts involving long hours of commuting, is one of the primary reasons for a guest being or not being a promoter. Certainly, the location is not in control of the hotel staff, but in case the hotel is not at the best location, provide complimentary local transport to ensure that the guests do not face any trouble by providing an easier means of transportation to their desired destinations. Hence, eliminating your hotel location as a factor for dissatisfaction and ensuring it does not hamper their overall stay experience.e) Collect Feedback on property – Ask for guest feedback while they are still at your property. The guest feels important and respected, and this increases your chances of dealing with an unpleasant situation (bad experience), if any, well before they exit the hotel, thereby making sure that the damage control activity has been done. Extending apology for any lag in service can take control of the situation and the hotel comes across as a responsible entity. On the other hand, in the absence of feedback collection activity, a furious guest would most likely become a detractor, and even a satisfied guest might turn into a neutral. However, just remember, the easier you make it for your guests to write a review, it is more likely that they will try to share a feedback with you.f) Dining Options and Experience – Availability of good dining facilities with flexible dining options has also been cited as one of the main reasons for a guest being a promoter, neutral or a detractor. A pleasant dining experience drives the guest to leave a positive remark for the hotel restaurant, and vice versa. Thereby increasing your revenue from your F&B domain also. Encourage and monitor feedback for your restaurant like- food quality, restaurant service, ambience, etc. In addition, work on areas receiving a neutral or a negative feedback.The biggest challenge is to work on their feedback and convert these detractors into promoters, so that the hotel continues to enjoy a favourable position and enhance profitability. To achieve this advanced ORM tools are capable of creating a goal in the system, assigning the same to your staff and not only this periodical tracking of the goals assigned to a staff. This helps a hotel not only identify an area of improvement, but also track its progress and completion.Promoters are the hotel’s biggest assets, and getting guests to become the promoters should be a key objective of the hotel’s marketing strategy. Having said that, it is extremely important to take the detractors and their opinion seriously. The best way to go ensure that your guests turn into your promoters is not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them.",https://rategain.com/blog/make-guests-promoters-hotel-brand/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-193620838-3000x1500-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-193620838-3000x1500-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632893a3f6fc78b8eba292,-1856152883,The Role and Future of Technology in Travel Industry,"August 28, 2017","It is a well- known and data backed information that technology has affected individuals and businesses to a considerable extent both in for advantages and disadvantages. The hospitality and travel industry is no exception. There has been enough debate on whether technology has benefited the travel industry or has harmed it more.The Internet, technology solutions, software & hardware and communications modes have made the processes of travel industry a lot easier for every participant. Technology has brought efficiency, automation, customer intelligence with data, and more business opportunities to offer to different customer needs, fast development in the market, innovation in product and service offerings, traveler data and opportunity for new entrants industry calls them disruptors too. Airbnb (Uber as well) is a classic case; the concept of staying in people’s homes when traveling is not a new concept and dates back many centuries. Technology has been able to accelerate this to a fast-moving and easily accessible global phenomenon.Thanks to technology and the internet, data is now available to everybody easily. Having said that, what adds value to the traveler is relevant and structured insights from this data, mixed with the right kind of intelligence and insights from it. This is where travel technology tools come handy.\n\nTechnology tools have played a pivotal role of the driver of this change of coming up with the right kind of traveler experience based on very specific customer needs and know-how of how these travelers want to see it, buy it and experience it. Mobility, monitoring of personal/social activity and especially predictive analytics are what will affect the new business opportunities and business models.Key actions for what tour and travel companies to keep up pace with changing market needs –\n\n• Mobile optimized website\n\n• Easy to navigation and ease of booking\n\n• High-resolution pictures for travelers to like your property and book directly on your brand website.\n\n• Follow your guests on social media and communicate with them (likes/dislikes and reviews)\n\n• Enable them to share their experiences with other prospect guests on relevant review and social media platformsThe travel industry is moving rapidly from traffic patterns to a web/mobile history where data is recorded, stored and analyzed to address individual traveler requirements. The future of travel is based on a combination of the following aspects:• Organized Data: This is not limited to the gathering of data from multiple sources, but also arranging it in a right structured manner, to be utilized for business use. This will further enhance the capability of managing non-structured data to take it into use.• Improved Service: A strategy to focus on improving the customer experience end to end – from digital self-service to human all service. Making it an absolutely fantastic experience for the consumer with a perfect amalgamation of technology and human touch.• Real –time Data: Speed and freshness of the information outline its real value. Today the value data is in real- time. Customers want every information instant and latest- instant bookings, instant comparison, instant confirmation, instant cancellation. Thus, explains the expanding use of tools like RateShopper in Travel and Hospitality by the service providers. If consumers are making price comparison on Metasearch sites, then it makes all the sense for its providers also to understand the market dynamics and their competition pricing strategy.• Analytics: Thorough understanding of consumer behavior through analytics, usage of customer predictive analytics and solutions on price optimization to maximize growth, profitability and customer experience are all necessary component for revenue management.With all these benefits and abundant paybacks, users at both ends of this chain benefit, however, there is one challenge that travel companies face. With the wide spread reach of the internet, booking engines and online travel portals, OTAs, etc. to the traveler, travelers now are more educated from online research when they book with a travel company or a DMC.Tour operators in order to be able to service this educated and aware traveler, need more skill & competencies to recognize the existing knowledge of the customer and still enhance their offering while completing their reservation. Which they will be able to achieve with tools and technology.Having said that, despite all the technology at their disposal, all travelers still love having an expert help to sort out the complexities of planning their vacations.It has become vital for traditional travel agencies to modernize their strategies in order to survive in the dynamic travel market. The modern day e-Commerce driven atmosphere helps them enhance their personalization, content, and efficiency to the market.\n\nMore than half of the travel companies believe that even with all these challenges, technology has truly proved to be a blessing for the industry since it helps to stimulate the personal touch and manage travel transactions of different permutation & combinations. Travel agents are still responsible for almost 77% of the total cruise bookings, 55% of air travel bookings and 73% of travel package bookings., as per Questex Travel Group.According to travel companies, the growth and progressions in technology have helped to enhance communication, convenience, productivity, the speed of business, marketing and revenue.\n\nThe traditional travel companies and tour & packages operators no doubt will see further evolution as technology continues to advance every single day. As long as demand for packaged travel remains, there will still be a place for travel companies/OTAs both online and off. Technology will go a long way in fulfilling this demand for consumers at both the ends.",https://rategain.com/blog/role-future-technology-travel-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Social-media-travel-industry-300x207-1-1100x759-1-570x285.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Social-media-travel-industry-300x207-1-1100x759-1-570x285.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Travel technology tools,,,,,,,0

65632898a3f6fc78b8eba296,-217101675,Measuring Demand in Your City will Skyrocket your Revenue - Here is How!,"August 21, 2017","We all know that demand forecasting is the holy grail of revenue generation for hotels. As hoteliers, you need to measure room and hotel demand at various levels and for different market segments to develop profit-making strategies. It involves gathering sizeable information of the market and integrate the efforts of different departments to enhance your business performance.How do you go about measuring demand? You could be missing the benefits that a simple tweak to your approach can bring – focusing on city demand forecasting.Unprecedented demand offers an opportunity to earn more revenue. However, with a new or a rare event coming to your city you need to create a new Revenue Strategy to tap this demand because you do not want to land up in a situation where there are not enough rooms to sell when the hotel demand is at its peak and you miss the opportunity to sell your rooms at a premium price.Earlier, the hotel PMS provided all the data used for forecasting within a hotel. This system holds years of historical information across a variety data types like – room types, customer segments, the length of stays and more. With that data along with booking pace, hotels generated forecasts and thus made pricing strategy. But, were those pricing decisions ideal? Perhaps not. Here is why.Big data is providing a new facet to the hotel demand forecasting. New data sources like air booking data, social reviews, ratings, and even weather—can help hotels better understand the opportunity of their upcoming demand.Today, there is a lot of information available about consumer shopping habits. New data points include competitor-pricing, events in your town and macro-economic & geographic factors, air booking data, social reviews and ratings, weather, and web shopping data.• Events and other economic Factors – Advance information about events, festivals, conferences happening in your city is very important, it simply means increased demand. Other local factors, like economic or political development, can play a big role in hotel demand creation as well.• Social Reviews and Rating—Better reviews lead to higher demand, which means you can increase pricing and maintain occupancy.• Weather conditions – Good weather can affect hotel demand and the same goes for bad weather. If you are in a weather-driven city, the impact can be even greater.• Web-Shopping Data—Knowing who is shopping, when and why they are not booking, can provide incredible insight.• Air Booking Data – Following are some of the most trusted and effective ways in which you can forecast local demand through a careful analysis of booking data of airlines.It is suggested that each data type should be measured and the most applicable information should be included in your pricing strategy.Forecasting demand through data from airlines; an intelligent approach\n\nFrom the airline reservation data, hotels can specifically check for future bookings (demand) for their city. In the case of one-day-return bookings, you can be certain that they mostly corporate meetings. By the same token, in the case of flight bookings for longer durations, vacation, would imply an increase in hotel demand in that period and dates.Throughout the year, you must periodically check airline bookings data to ascertain the way in which the number of bookings to your city very over several months. This gives you a clear picture of the low, medium and high seasons for your business. This helps you strategize in advance for every season and derive the revenue targets accordingly. For example, if you see an increase in hotel demand for say October, say 2 months from today. A revenue manager can plan to hold some inventory for October, which they can sell at a higher price which demand rises.Check the increase in the number of flight bookings during the holiday season. Here, you must take care of the fact that holiday seasons may differ for adults (singles) and children (read it family) and as per geography also. Say, a tourist from few countries may holiday in Aug- Sept when schools are closed and some may have holidays in December. Service class or professionals may get their annual holiday allowance in the month of December, while some school/college students have holidays in autumn. Hence, a revenue manager can design custom packages targeted at young and millennial guests much before vacation season hits to tap this segment since most travelers plan much in advance and thus plan hotel inventory distribution and price accordingly.\n\nKeeping a check on competitor rates also helps largely. RateShopping your competitor rates will give you fair ideas of how they are priced on specific dates and period.With all these findings it is clear that you need to focus more on forecasting demand just like any other revenue management aspect to keep your hotel business at the top of its game. However, accuracy in forecasts can only be achieved through meticulous analysis of the right kind of data. You can utilize online tools such as Google Analytics to analyze the demographics of your website visitors. For procuring realistic data and its automated analysis, you can also use Hotel Rate Shopping Tools that can help you with this analysis and insights. It will make your job a lot easier.To yield better revenues and stay ahead of your competitors; you must measure room demand from a geographical standpoint with an emphasis on proximity to the targeted market.",https://rategain.com/blog/measuring-hotel-demand-city-skyrocket-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotelier-demand-forecasting-762x381-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotelier-demand-forecasting-762x381-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Demand forecasting,Rate shopping,,,,,,0
6563289ca3f6fc78b8eba298,189443183,7 Best Methods to Gather Quality Guest Feedback,"August 16, 2017","While planning their travel, people usually lay down their requirements and then search for the best property to stay from a multitude of options available, online or offline. Undoubtedly, there are a plethora of choices available nowadays, where ranking and reviews play a big role in helping travellers narrow down their choices and take a quick decision. Of course, the hotels with less or no reviews at all are considered less trusted by travellers, since it indicates that probably not many people must have visited or liked that property. This, in turn, means less number of bookings for the hotel and therefore a loss of revenue. Not an ideal situation, certainly!It is quite clear from the above that guest feedback and reviews are of utmost importance in the current scenario, on which depends the fate of the hotel – reputation, reservations and ultimately, revenues. With so much at stake, hotels all around the world are laying extra emphasis on delivering an excellent experience to their guests and then ensuring that most of them share their experience, which would help them improve their services and grow their business by ensuring high visibility.\n\nAn increase in the number of reviews (positive or negative), or the lack of it, can make or break the image of the hotel. Moreover, with the internet being a magical thing in the hands of all, travellers can check reviews of any hotel around the world in seconds. As a result, the industry has become cautious than ever before. The significance and volume of online reviews have grown over the period of time. In fact, Online Reputation Management has emerged as a key function in the hospitality industry, with distinct, expert professionals dedicated towards the fulfilment of the task.Having said that, it is certainly not that easy to have your guests scribble a few lines or perhaps a few words about their experience at your hotel. Below are some quick tips for hoteliers to encourage maximum guest feedback and reviews –1) The earlier, the better – Do not delay the process of feedback collection; the guest might lose interest to share one if it gets too late. The best time to ask them about the same is while they are still at your property, preparing for check-out. This presents an excellent opportunity for hoteliers to collect authentic feedback and you still have an opportunity to transform a negative experience into a positive one.\n\nIn case you are unable to collect the feedback at the time of check-out, make sure you do the same within a few days or maximum within a week. If done later than that, it is most likely going to be a futile attempt.2) Know your guest – Each guest arriving at your hotel is going to be unique, having a different set of expectations, outlook, choice and of course, different age and gender. Hence, sticking to only one way of feedback collection might not lead to results and adopting different channels for a different set of guests could be the ideal way. Of course, one particular guest should not be bombarded with multiple kinds of surveys, or you will end up irritating him. Therefore, it is important to know your guest right and pick up the best channel for feedback collection, depending upon the type of guest. For example, a paper survey might work well for some, while an online email survey will be better suited for a few others. Some travellers might choose to drop a review on the hotel’s mobile app, while some might take to a review platform.3) Deliver a fantastic experience – Make feedback collection an exciting activity, which is possible only if you know that you have done the ground work right; i.e. when you make sure that the guests have had a delightful stay at your property and everything was in the right order according to their requirements. Once you know that you are at a flawless side, and you have given the guests enough good points to talk about, you must not be scared to ask for a feedback. Moreover, a guest, if satisfied, is most likely to leave a positive note and will be most pleased to do the same at the time of check-out itself. So, grab the opportunity and increase your chances of generating maximum reviews, and that too, positive.4) Be precise – Guests might choose to skip the feedback process entirely if the survey method is too cluttered or lengthy. Therefore, it is important to keep it simple and to ask relevant questions, which would not take too much time and serve your purpose at the same time. For example, asking the guests how was their stay and what is the one thing that could be done to improve their experience, usually works well. In addition, in case you are providing an e-check out the facility to your guests, you could also redirect them to publish their reviews on Google reviews where feedback can be shared quite conveniently.5) Enhance your online presence, especially on social media – A key platform with tremendous brand building potential where you can easily receive maximum guest feedback is online, especially through the social media channels. In fact, according to a survey, 93% of global travellers make their bookings based on online reviews. A separate survey reveals that 53% of the travellers would not even book a hotel that does not have online reviews. These reviews can be positive or negative, but the number of online reviews definitely play an important role. Hoteliers must keep a constant check on this channel and devise an appropriate strategy to get maximum feedback there and to respond to the same in the best manner. Remember, today’s tech savvy traveller is constantly glued to social media for even the tiniest requirements, and hotels with the right social media strategy could easily take a front position in the competitive race, and attract maximum bookings.6) Do not offer incentives for reviews – Hotels must definitely encourage guests to provide reviews and should not be afraid of asking for it outright. However, they should not resort to the method of providing incentives (freebies and discounts) to guests for doing the same, as it could hamper the image of the hotel to a large extent. Incentives could be offered for a variety of other things so that the guest becomes happy and is automatically prompted to share a feedback. Offering incentives could be looked down by some as a cheap tactic and the review could be regarded as a paid review.7) Convey that you value the guest feedback – Asking for feedback should never come across as a forced exercise. Rather, the guest should know that the hotel values their presence at the property and therefore their feedback is extremely valuable. Physical materials like window stickers and medium sized cards stating the importance of guest feedback could be placed at right locations that work as constant reminders to them that it is important for them to share their experience.Follow these quick tips to generate a higher volume of guest feedback, which would further improve your online position and ranking on search engines and review sites.  As your visibility improves, your potential guests can easily locate your hotel online. Moreover, when they flip through the feedback (positive or negative), your hotel certainly appears reliable and trustworthy in comparison to competitors. Remember, your guests are your true brand advocates!",https://rategain.com/blog/methods-gather-hotel-guest-feedback/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Business-Man-Select-Happy-156570752-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Business-Man-Select-Happy-156570752-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0

656328a1a3f6fc78b8eba29c,-1470753401,"Hotels, Utilize Closed User Group (CUG) Customers to Increase Revenue Through Direct Bookings","August 8, 2017","There is no need to emphasize much about the importance of Direct Bookings for hotels, as this is a common knowledge to every hotelier and revenue manager.We have discussed at length about ways to increase direct bookings in our earlier blogs – Hotels, Let’s go direct and How to increase hotel direct bookings?In this blog, we will share how you should utilize your Closed User Group (CUG) consumers to get more direct bookings and a healthy bottom-line.To begin, let us talk a bit about what qualifies a guest as a CUG member of a hotel. Consumers who become members by their will and actively opt in for the CUG program, receive a member profile that is accessed by a login id and password. To assist consumers and to make it easier for them to access CUG rates, some hotels select to publish their preferred rates directly in the search results of their hotel website.Moreover, of course, the guest should have made a minimum of one un-discounted booking prior to becoming a closed user group member.Hotels very often use CUG clause as an exception to Rate Parity Clause with OTAs, to the conditions that the hotel cannot undercut rates given to the OTA directly on their brand websites.Apart from this, Hotels and OTAs also have Guests Loyalty Programs to take a relief from Parity Clause and offer better rates to their loyal customers. Nevertheless, this is more of a customer retention scheme, where the consumer is able to gain some benefit over a period of time by being loyal to a hotel brand.What benefits do hotels get from Closed User Group guests –CUG selling is a strategic inventory distribution decision since Customer Life Time Value is what is more important to hotels than a just one-time sale. The whole profitability of such consumers can only be calculated over a period of time by Customer Life Cycle Value and Customer Acquisition Cost.One important aspect to keep in mind when you are focusing on direct bookings is that hotels should pay special attention to make the booking experience on the hotel website and overall browsing experience absolutely user-friendly and seamless for the online users. CUG members should also be able to make their bookings in a few clicks if we want them to actively use CUG member program for their hotel bookings.If negotiation or any changes in rate parity regulation give hotels free reign to control pricing by channel, let us keep our fingers crossed to see what position CUGs will have in the distribution mix in future. Considering that hotels are keeping closed user groups prices more open, we can expect a more transparent market for consumers in future.",https://rategain.com/blog/utilize-closed-user-group-customers-increase-revenue-direct-bookings/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bigstock-Support-Help-Unity-Togethernes-118375838-2800x1400-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bigstock-Support-Help-Unity-Togethernes-118375838-2800x1400-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Rate disparity issues,Rate parity,,,,,,0
656328a5a3f6fc78b8eba29e,2142288692,Create a Revenue Centric Culture in your Hotel by Integrating Technology,"August 2, 2017","Part 3 of 3Integrating Technology to Drive More RevenueIn the previous part of this blog series, we discussed Guest Sentiment and your Online Presence. In the 3rd and final part of the blog series, Building a Revenue Centric Culture in your Hotel, we will discuss the topic of Integrating Hotel Technology to Drive More Revenue.Back in 2008 while I was working for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, I remember my boss always saying Speed to Market is the key to driving market share. She was a champion for technology development and always looking for the best, quickest and most seamless ways to integrate hotel technology in order to drive more market share. It was a lesson for me early on that technology is a key component in the hotel eco-system and driving revenue.It is incredible to see the great advances in hotel technology we have made over the last decade. It is true, as an industry, we had to adapt to such rapid growth. However, many experts also say that as an industry, we are still way behind on technological advances.A study by EY Global pointed out that internet travel booking software revenue has grown by more than 73% over the past five years. At the same time, the competition to gain control of the distribution channel has intensified. Through acquisitions of property management and digital marketing platforms, online travel agents (OTAs) are providing additional services to encourage hoteliers to distribute rooms on their sites.As the big chains have the budgets for technology and marketing power to address these issues, many independent hotels or smaller chains are left feeling overwhelmed in trying to make similar advances in technology. Because of this, it´s imperative that hotels understand the options available to them. Find the solutions that work the best for you and your staff and at the same time, understand that hotel technology is a very valuable investment. Do not rush into the decision and take your time to explore the different providers and what kind of integrations/interfaces are possible between the various systems so that everything is “talking”.According to the Hotel Tech Report, The average hotel runs on more than 20 different technology systems and that number continues to grow with the shift to cloud architectures and open API environments. Although that number might be a bit lower for stand-alone and independent hotels it is still a staggering statistic and brings some light to the fact that we must look for a more holistic approach to hotel technology development. Let us explore a few ways that you can start building a revenue centric culture through technology developments in your hotel(s).<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""wp-image-11658 aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Channel_Manager_GR.jpg"" alt=""hotel technology_channel manager"" width=""642"" height=""321"" />    Hotels must comprehensively embrace technology in order to have solid analytics, drive business improvements, enhance guest´s experiences and deliver results. It is the job of the hotelier to keep up with rapid technology changes and assume the latest in technology. The success of these adoptions will differentiate successful hotels moving forward.Guests Contribution",https://rategain.com/blog/revenue-centric-culture-integrated-hotel-technology/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Teamwork-And-Integration-Conce-66966004-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Teamwork-And-Integration-Conce-66966004-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Channel_Manager_GR.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Karen-2.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Demand forecasting,price optimization,Revenue Management,,,,,0
656328a7a3f6fc78b8eba2a0,-860563269,"Hoteliers, Are You Using Mobile to Support Your Online Reputation Management?","July 31, 2017","Fast adaptation of mobile technologies, has made it easier both for hotel and travel companies and consumers to share and access information easily on the move. Smart hoteliers are no longer chained to their desks and cubicle; instead, they are active on social media and review sites. Consequently, online reputation management (ORM) has become a 24/7 job that demands real-time responsiveness. In the same fashion the ability to access guest feedback, while on the go, is becoming vital. In fact, ORM is a combination of Social Media, Localization and Mobile App i.e. SoLoMo is a very important recipe for a successful Online Reputation Management Plan.This explains the reason why vendors are promoting the mobile ORM application as part of a hotel’s overall plan. Hotels are also increasingly adopting Hotel Online Reputation Management App as they have come to know about the significant benefits it can bring to their hotel’s reputation and revenue.Below in this blog, we are sharing a few ways mobile applications or mobile optimized tools can assist your online reputation management efforts:Table of ContentsReal time response to guest reviewsWith mobile enabled ORM tool, your team will be able to monitor online review and social media feedback in real-time and respond immediately to the feedback that requires immediate attention. ORM is all about managing issues before the matter gets worse.More visibility across all departmentsMobile based online reputation management uplifts the visibility of guest feedback across all members of the hotel staff. This enables all departments to work on their areas of improvements by assigning specific goals to them. This way all department collaboratively contribute to enhancing the online reputation of their hotel.Make day-to-day operations more efficient and flexibleA mobile solution offers your staff members a chance to respond to a guest concern no matter where they are or what they are dealing with. This flexibility allows your hotel operational teams to remain responsive yet still engaged on the floor without causing significant delays or disruptions.Ask for Feedback from Your Guests to Enhance your Reviews and RankingsWhen you pay attention to the experiences your guests have at your hotel, this will eventually lead to higher revenues. Create a survey that asks for feedback from your guests after they spend some time at your hotel. Read the feedback that you receive carefully, as this feedback can directly influence your overall profits.When guests are unhappy, they are more likely to go on social media channels to share their negative experience. If you get a complaint from a guest, take the time to do some investigation. While you may learn that the guest complaint is not valid, you may also learn that you have a problem with one of your employees that need to be addressed. For those that leave positive feedback, you can ask that they leave a review online to help boost business.Guest surveys and loyalty programs are easy to share when you have a list of subscribers to send marketing materials. Use text messaging to gather valuable feedback, or offer deals to your guests. Keep high-end rooms full by offering upgrades at a discount, and let guests know about any special events going on each day at your hotel.When you are looking for strategies to increase your hotel revenue, your hotel’s customer service and how you connect with guests should be your priorities. Mobile and text messaging is the easiest and most effective way to connect. Hotels are increasingly using mobile and text messaging for activities like –Offer Guests an Upgrade Through a Text MessageWhen you have higher end rooms in your hotel that are empty, this results in an overall revenue loss. To fill these rooms with paying guests, you can offer an upgrade to guests already staying at your hotel. 90% of text messages are read within three minutes, so your guests will find out about the upgrade opportunity right away.You will need to be careful, as you do not want to send out a discounted rate for an upgraded room to guests already paying full price for the better room. Look at the guests staying at your hotel, and only send out the text message for a discounted upgrade to those who are staying in one of your standard rooms. Guests will feel that you are paying attention to their needs, and many are likely to go for the upgrade if the discount is good enough.Promote Services Going on Within Your Hotel Through Text MessagingOnce guests sign up to receive text messages from you, it is important to use this form of communication wisely. Take the time to send thoughtful, deal worthy messages to your guests and do not bombard them with useless messages. If you have a spa at your hotel, a quick text to notify your guests about spa deals or openings can help boost sales at your spa. If you have an onsite restaurant and it is a slow night, send out a text for a free appetizer for the next couple of hours to fill up your restaurant.When you communicate effectively with guests regarding services that are available on site, you have a better chance of guests utilizing these services.Hotels that are non-hesitant to adopt technology solutions for Online Reputation Management and are effectively utilizing their social media platforms for communicating and understanding their consumers better are reaping the benefits of managing their online reputation by witnessing an increase in their direct bookings and thus revenue.For a free trial of our Online Reputation Management tool, click here.Guests ContributionKhen Rhie\n\nKen Rhie is the CEO of Trumpia, which earned a reputation as the most complete SMS solution including user-friendly user interface and API for mobile engagement, Smart Targeting, advanced automation, enterprise, and cross-channel features for both mass texting and landline texting use cases.

In addition, research also shows that guests are willing to pay a higher price for hotels with outstanding customer feedback.On the other hand, poor reviews or a poor overall score on certain hotel distribution channels can impact upon your ability to sell rooms through those distribution channels, which could result in lower revenue than would otherwise be possible.Tips For Managing Online ReviewsBelow, we have compiled a list of seven useful tips to help you manage your online reviews:The single best way to manage your online reviews is to do everything in your power to provide a pleasant experience for your guests.

In the most simple terms, the more happy customers you have, the more positive reviews you are likely to receive.An important part of managing online reviews includes actively encouraging your guests to leave reviews in the first place. Be careful offering incentives to guests for writing a review. This can come across as buying good feedback. But a polite request or a gentle reminder can help to boost the number of reviews you receive, which will make your hotel seem more in demand, while also minimising the damage from negative reviews.In addition to requesting online reviews, you should also ask for as much feedback from guests as you can in general, including offline feedback. This will allow you to get a sense of the sort of things your guests are saying about your hotel, can help you to identify areas of weakness and can allow you to make changes, so that future online reviews will not bring up the same complaints or negative experiences.One common mistake made by hotels when trying to encourage online reviews is only contacting guests in one language. In reality, most hotels have guests from all over the world stay there and it is important that their views are heard too – especially if you want to attract other guests who speak their language. Send any emails asking for feedback out in multiple languages to ensure you do not exclude large numbers of guests.Even for the best hotels, the occasional negative review is inevitable. Most people researching your hotel will not necessarily be put off by one or two negative reviews, as long as you respond appropriately. Be friendly, avoid seeming argumentative, acknowledge any constructive feedback and if you disagree with aspects of the review, address them calmly, without dismissing the issues raised outright.In many cases, hotels spend too much time responding to criticism and not enough time acknowledging the people who have made the effort to leave positive feedback. Where possible, try to respond to as much positive feedback as you can as well. People who see that you take the time to do this may be more likely to leave positive comments themselves, because they know their words will be read and appreciated.Finally, it is essential that you look at your online reviews regularly and analyse them. Keep track of the ratio of positive to negative reviews and make it your mission to improve this ratio. Look for words that come up the most often and consider what message is being sent out about your hotel. If there are certain negative words that are repeated, it is probably worth considering taking some action to make changes.In the modern, digital world, online reviews are an important consideration for any hotel reputation management strategy. Negative reviews can damage your ability to sell rooms and make money, but there are steps that can be taken to manage the online response to your hotel, in order to maximise positive feedback and minimise the damage caused by any negative reviews. By following the eight tips above, you should be able to achieve this.Guests ContributionMartijn Barten\n\nMartijn Barten has over 10 years of experience in developing, implementing and managing revenue management processes and strategies for individual properties and multi-properties.

All the responsibility comes on the shoulders of the hotel’s revenue manager (RM)If you as an RM of the hotel are updating inventory manually across multiple OTAs, then you are missing the opportunity to engage directly with your customers and wasting your precious time, which you could have spent strategizing. Your competition, however, may be doing things differently and may be using the latest technology to manage inventory automatically.Managing distribution via few clicks is possible; however, there are a few points to consider when choosing a channel manager for your hotel.Below are some of the features that you as a Revenue Manager should keep on top of your mind before you commit to a channel manager, as once you buy the solution moving to a different one can be an even arduous task.If you follow these basic rules when you purchase your next channel manager, your life would be easier and your hotel would be able to reap the benefits of total revenue management.Ask for a Demo Today!",https://rategain.com/blog/features-consider-choosing-hotel-channel-manager/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Channel-Management-Features-to-Choose-the-Right-Hotel-Channel-Manager.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Channel-Management-Features-to-Choose-the-Right-Hotel-Channel-Manager.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,,,,,,0
656328b3a3f6fc78b8eba2a6,1033235435,Managing Hotel Guest Sentiment and Online Presence to Create Revenue Centric Culture,"July 19, 2017","Part 2 of 3Managing Hotel Guest Sentiment and your Online PresenceIn part 1 of this blog series, we discussed ways to get your entire staff empowered and involved in Revenue Generating activities. In part 2 of the series, Creating a Revenue Centric Culture for you Hotel, we will explore the subject of Hotel Guest Sentiment and your Online Presence.I think by now most hoteliers understand that higher hotel guest sentiment leads to power in pricing. In addition, having a solid amount of reviews gives consumers confidence in making their decision. Taking that one step further, interacting with your guests via social media and review sites allows you to further show engagement and empathy with guests. Let´s look at some recent research around the above:I think most are familiar with the study by Chris Anderson of Cornell which indicates that online reputation (review scores) and the number of reviews are positively related to hotel performance as measured by price, occupancy, and total revenue.In a very recent study by Cornell we look a bit deeper into how responding to reviews has an impact on the actual review scores. The study indicates that “while responding to reviews is positively related to online reputation, hotels are better off responding to negative reviews than to positive reviews, adding that responding to all positive reviews may become detrimental.” This has become an interesting study as in the recent past, hotels were encouraged to respond to all reviews, regardless the connotation….that might be changing. The study goes on to say “Our data don’t tell us why this is so, but we could infer that consumers potentially become annoyed by all the review responses or the responses crowd out the reviews. We caution hoteliers regarding how they respond, as our analysis indicates that responding to all reviews is unnecessary and potentially detrimental on both review scores and revenues.”  So the question here is how to we continue to engage with guests on review sites without being overly “annoying”?This can be something interesting to study at your individual hotels to understand the impact. Perhaps consider a different approach by sending the guest that left a positive review a personal email of thanks rather than replying via the review site. This could also be a good way to invite them back, or ask them to refer the hotel to a friend. Try sending them a discount code as part of this email so they are enticed to book again or share with their networks.According to a recent survey, 93% of prospect travelers refer to online reviews when booking a hotel. Furthermore, 53% of the traveler would not even book a hotel that does not have online reviews. I do not think these facts are surprising to anybody, however, still a good reminder of the importance of your online reputation.Ensure that your hotel has a dependable ORM in place which allows you to manage your online hotel guest sentiment in one easy to use solution. Furthermore, involve your entire staff in tracking and improving hotel guest sentiment.As mentioned in part 1 of the blog series around revenue generating activities, there should also be goals set per department in terms of hotel guest sentiment and these goals should be tracked, measured and celebrated when achieved! Be sure to also measure each area of hotel vs the competitive set and see how you can strive to make improvements in weak areas and continue to highlight the areas where you excel. Get creative in finding ways to improve. It does not always have to be the obvious. I will share a couple of examples.While working with a boutique hotel on revenue improvement strategies, we understood that there were a handful of rooms in the hotel that were inferior in terms of size and view however these were included as part of the standard room category. The guests that usually stayed in these particular room had a more negative experience and left poor reviews. So we decided to create a new room category, called Small Room, which included these rooms. The description was much more accurate in terms of size and photos. That combined with offering this room for -10€ off the price of the standard category we were better managing the expectations of the customers. This lead to a huge boost in the review scores from guests in this particular room type and of course improved the overall score of the hotel.Another example from the same hotel was negative feedback around the breakfast. Guests often complained that the breakfast area was too small, sometimes lacking places to sit and that they found the price of breakfast to be too expensive. From our side, our hands were a bit tied in regards to the price as it was a rather extensive buffet and our costs were somewhat high. We had little room to decrease the price of the breakfast. What we did do however was come up with a breakfast box to-go plan where the guests had to pay 5€ (instead of 14€) and they received a modified version of breakfast in a to-go container. By doing this, it also took care of the problem of seating as many of the guests went back to their rooms to eat or left the hotels to start the day with breakfast on the road. We also saw breakfast costs rise as more people bought the to-go option while previously they were opting out of breakfast all-together.  In only 6 months we saw the breakfast revenues rise 12% and equally as important, saw the guest scores climb!So the lesson learned in the above examples is creating opportunities via innovation while improving guest satisfaction and creating new revenue streams. It´s not that difficult, think outside the box and involve your staff in coming up with innovative ideas.Another important area to focus on while creating a Revenue Culture for your hotel is optimizing your online presence in order to correctly showcase and sell your hotel. Although it can be cumbersome, I suggest doing a content audit at least 1 time each year. This includes going over your hotel with a fine tooth comb on each and every site where you have an online presence. Ensure that all details, small and large, of your hotel are correctly portrayed. You would be surprised to find some small details missing or incorrect, however these details can be very important for the conversion. If you do not agree with or do not like the descriptions that the OTAs have come up with, chat with your Market Managers, sometimes they can consider making changes for you so that you feel more comfortable with how your hotel is displayed.Do not stop with the OTAs, ensure that you have also claimed your profile on the Metasearch sites as well. Nowadays this is critical to ensuring good online conversion and market share. In a recent study from Koddi, MetaSearch traffic has grown over 3x´s from 2014-2017 and is projected to drive 33€ billion in bookings in 2017. Optimize your profile on these sites by improving the photos, descriptions and features. Ensure that all of your amenities are well listed and actively manage your reviews. Make sure that you have high quality photos of all room types and areas of the hotel. Your main image is the first point of contact between the potential guest and your hotel. Be sure to put your best representation as your main image. Trivago research shows that 86% of clicks goes to profiles with a high-quality main image. The research goes on to say that Profiles with high-quality photos receive 63% more clicks than profiles with low-quality or no photos. It´s an important part of revenue generation and hotels must take an active role in creating and managing quality content for better sales and conversion.I hope the above suggestions have given you some new ideas to consider. The most important takeaways from the above:*Know what your guests are saying and take an active role in managing your hotel guest sentiment*Constantly strive for excellence and positive change via innovation*Ensure your online presence is optimized in order to drive more sales and better conversionImplementing the above to further expand your mindset of creating a Revenue Culture and take, you one-step closer to becoming a better run and more profitable hotel.

656328b6a3f6fc78b8eba2a8,2016814803,"Hoteliers, You Need a Channel Manager with an Edge to Stand out from Competition","July 18, 2017","A recent study reveals that approximately 90% of travel bookings are done online, compared to just 50% a decade ago. This clearly explains the increasing trend of booking travel online by the consumers. It also justifies the reason why hoteliers need to master distribution and do it soon because the hotels that will invest in their channel optimization and distribution strategies will certainly emerge as the next generation of winners in the hospitality industry.To make the task easier, having a hospitality and travel technology partner that truly understands distribution will certainly provide them a head start in this task.We have already shared a detailed guide on “Selecting the Right Online Channel Manager”. In this article, we are going to focus on some significant features of a channel distribution tool that can help you get maximum benefit with little effort and stand out from the competition.Most of the technology vendors offer the same set of features that make all channel manager tools in the market behave alike with similar benefits. However, a few innovative vendors offer cutting edge features, which make their solution stand apart from other channel distribution tools.The hotels that use a modern and advance channel manager benefit from it by generating more revenue owing to increased focus on their hotel room distribution strategy. Hence, when you as a hotelier decide to invest your money in a Hotel Channel Distribution Manager, look for a feature that will completely set you apart from the crowd.Let us understand this a little further; the whole purpose of adopting a channel manager is to make your inventory allocation, distribution, channel connection and inventory updates easier. The cost of having a channel manager will be justified only if it gives you enough benefits over the manual process of doing the same.To explain this a bit more – Adding new online channels/OTAs is not quite an easy procedure in most of the tools available. However, a tool that can accomplish this in a few minutes will be a highly beneficial solution pertaining to the dynamic market conditions.Thus, pioneering technology solution providers are introducing channel managers with features that can help simplify the lives of revenue managers. Every revenue manager will certainly appreciate the ability to add new channels/OTAs with just a few clicks and in a matter of minutes.Since hotels adopting dynamic pricing have to continually adjust rates in response to ever-changing supply/demand conditions, the constant challenge is to determine the optimal room price on a given day. The whole process becomes highly time-consuming if you have to manually do this for 5-hotel chain with 100 rooms each.A revenue manager has to keep a tab on competitor’s rate throughout the day and this might require them to change rates for their hotel’s inventory also. This could be for any specific room category or all of them. A revenue manager’s life can be much sorted if she can do this task in one go for the next 365 days of the year. This is a much-needed feature your channel manager should possess so that you are on top of the competition.Having a channel manager with this kind of ability will free the revenue manager from this routine job, as this will be very well taken care of by the distribution tool and the revenue manager will devote her productive hours in a more strategic role than a mundane task like this.Apart from this, when you pick your channel manager, also see the number of channels/OTAs it is connected with. An advanced channel manager tool should possess the flexibility to connect with multiple OTA’s (As many as 400- 500) seamlessly and manage their inventory, providing online distribution of room rates, real-time reservation and availability.While these cutting-edge features are highly appreciated, we cannot ignore the importance of common features like a user-friendly navigation and user interface. Along with that, using a channel manager should not require a high level of expertise and training. A basic hands-on of the tool should enable the users to use the tool without any trouble. Having said that, it is always desirable if your technology vendors provide you 24X7 customer support. Solution providers are going a step ahead to support their customers by provisions like chat options which are available to provide live support to customers for any issue arising any time.Focusing on online distribution strategy has become essential if hoteliers want to retain customers, improve hotel positioning, and gain a competitive lead in markets that are very often saturated with hotel supply. So, hoteliers should now be well informed as to where to invest their money when looking for an online distribution channel which gives them the most suitable services for their property. Happy Distributing!",https://rategain.com/blog/right-hotel-channel-manager-stand-out-competitive-edge/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Distribution-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Distribution-900x450.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,,,,,,0
656328bca3f6fc78b8eba2aa,1605322689,"Hoteliers, Learn How to Create A Revenue Centric Culture in Your Hotel","July 10, 2017","Part 1 of 3In today´s highly visible online market place we simply cannot stop with a friendly smile and helpful staff to continue to see profits rise. We must build a Revenue Centric Culture inside the hotel and ensure that the entire hotel staff understands the importance of running a profitable hotel and contributing to the success with the right hotel management strategy.In part 1 of the series, How to Build a Revenue Centric Culture in Your Hotel, we will discuss 8 ways you can engage your entire staff to become Hotel Revenue Generators“During my days of working directly with hotels on revenue optimization, I was always surprised by the lack of understanding from the staff on the overall sales and distribution strategy of the hotel. One time, I even heard a receptionist tell a guest to go directly to an OTA to book the room instead of taking the reservation over the phone! Immediately I understood that not only does the hotel need more overall knowledge about the strategy and online room distribution, but they must be involved in the revenue generation activities of the hotel.”Due to the fact that most of the staff at independent hotels have a wide variety of tasks to perform, in depth training and including them in the hotel revenue generation activities can only be beneficial. Here´s how to start:  So the objective here is when you cannot capture the full 20€ at the time of booking, many guests are willing to pay a bit more during the time of check in if they are offered the options. Create an upsell program at the hotel that incentivizes the staff to partake in this important revenue generating activity!   Once you have implemented the above steps into your hotel culture you are well on your way to seeing more money come in the door. Plus chances are you also have increased the morale of the employees….we all know the saying…happy employees lead to happy guests! At the end of the day, as hoteliers, our job is to take care of the guest so they leave happy.Guests Contribution",https://rategain.com/blog/create-hotel-revenue-centric-culture/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Increase-Sales-Revenue-66983953-765x382-764x382-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Increase-Sales-Revenue-66983953-765x382-764x382-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Karen-2.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Revenue Management,Revenue maximization,,,,,,0
656328bfa3f6fc78b8eba2ac,1337807706,"Hoteliers, Learn About The Growing Importance of Hotel Online Reputation Management","July 4, 2017","“It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, but you can lose it in a minute”– Will Rogers Well said, indeed! Earning a good reputation is certainly not an overnight job. It is a continuous and incremental attempt towards high rating on online review sites and maximum positive reviews. Moreover, ensuring that online reputation management only gets better with time is a key concern and the topmost priority of all hotel revenue managers.Reviews rank second only to price as the most important factor considered by travelers looking for hotels. The hospitality industry is all about having a good service; a hotel or a restaurant known for its quality of service would definitely have a higher number of footfalls and of course good reviews. The Role of Technology and Social Media in ORMTechnology has advanced much and we have come a long way using it. It is the age of the Internet, where we all in a way have become expert critics, thanks to the growing use of social media. An angry or a dissatisfied guest in today’s world would hardly keep quiet, especially when he is aware of the powers extended by social media, which allows a guest to openly show all the frustration or discontentment to everyone thrashing the hotel’s image to bits.The reputation of the hotel, therefore, lies in the hands of the tech-savvy traveler, who is glued to the internet round the clock and is happy scribbling a few lines to share his experience with the online community that could very well influence their perception and booking decisions.The job of hotels is getting tougher day-by-day in an attempt to maintain a superior ranking, and they strive hard to deliver better guest experiences, which would lead to better rating and reviews.Online Reputation Management tools are even more important for big chain hotels and enterprises, having many branches to monitor. Technology vendors are offering solutions with enterprise dashboards that makes comprehensive monitoring much easier, with one single screen.ORM as a Key Function in HotelsOnline Reputation Management (ORM) has therefore emerged as a key function in the hotel industry, with dedicated groups of experts aligned to regularly monitor all social media channels and review sites to monitor and analyze what is being written about them, strategically responding to all comments, and taking rectifying steps for the negative feedback. Hence, Online Reputation Management has gained far more importance in the current era and the practice has now become an indispensable tool for measuring guest satisfaction.The Online Reputation Index is used to evaluate the hotel’s performance and compare results with comp-set. A high online reputation index means that your customer service is indeed great and you are exceeding the expectations of the guests. Hoteliers use this index to set quality objectives for themselves as well as to optimize online pricing and distribution strategies. Real time review on the go is also possible using the mobile app.A recent study shows that a mere 1% increase in reputation score leads to a 6.9% increase in Average Daily Rate – ADR. The same 1% increase in reputation score leads to 1.4% increase in occupancy.Thus, there is a direct and a high correlation between ORM, occupancy and revenue volumes. A better Online Reputation Management score definitely translates into higher revenue for hotels.Traditionally, ADR, RevPAR and occupancy rates have been the only KPAs in the hotel industry. However, in the technology-driven world, other KPAs like ratings, rankings, the number of reviews, guest satisfaction index, etc. have been added to this list. This again points towards the growing importance of ORM.In fact, 60% of all hotel bookings are now being done digitally, which means that a high volume of business in the industry is being generated through online sources. Out of this, OTAs have been driving the majority of the bookings (almost 72%)Thus, OTAs have a strong control over the hotel booking scenario. The review platforms offered by OTAs are, therefore, regarded as a highly credible source of information for travelers, which directly influence the hotel occupancy rates and bookings. Search for a hotel online, and the top results would be its profile on various review websites and social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. Definitely, this cannot be ignored!According to a survey, 93% of prospect travelers refer online reviews when booking a hotel. Furthermore, 53% of the traveler would not even book a hotel that does not have online reviews.Clearly, in such a scenario, positive reviews can work wonders for the hotel, while negative ones can prove to be detrimental for their growth. So, if you are a hotelier wanting to drive maximum bookings, make sure that you have lots of positive reviews spread across multiple platforms.Working backwards, in order to accumulate positive reviews, make sure you deliver great customer service. Well, the success mantra is to include Online Reputation Management as a part of the big business strategy of your hotel. In order to achieve this, hotels can roll out Guest Feedback Surveys to get real and true feedback from the guests during or post stay.A separate research has suggested that responding to a complaint on social media increases customer advocacy by as much as 25%. With such figures available, it is easy to say that online reputation management is a great revenue generation tool, justifying the reason why pro- revenue managers are taking it very seriously and are keeping a close watch at it with daily, weekly and monthly reports about their reviews and ratings.In fact, it is rightly said that reputation is equivalent to revenue; a good reputation means good revenue figures and vice versa. How to leverage online reviews to have a flawless reputation that increases revenue is what the hotels of today are constantly trying to figure out.Some Best Practices and Tactics for Effective ORM    Hotels with deep focus on quality, service, and the customer would definitely enjoy a strong goodwill and in turn, have a greater market share. On the other hand, those who neglect their online reputation management would die short term. Those that are going to win in the long run will be the ones who will continue to get positive reviews from all their guests.Winning hotels could also be the ones that keep improving their services based on the customer feedback.

656328c1a3f6fc78b8eba2ae,308558659,How to Make Restaurant’s Online Reputation a Secret Sauce in Enhancing your Hotel Brand?,"June 28, 2017","A couple of years ago I came across an article published by an Italian blog titled “Pizzeria sues TripAdvisor for psychological abuse”. I was intrigued and honestly curious to understand how a review site could possibly psychologically damage an inanimate thing like a restaurant, as I was sure that psychological traumas were a prerogative of mankind and, to a certain extent, animals.Digging through the blog I discovered that the owner of the pizzeria (I quote literally) “reserved the right to refuse to serve TripAdvisor users, because” he continued, “We are here to work and not to be the target of the frustration of reviewers”.As the name of the pizzeria was published in the article, I went online and checked his reputation and, not surprisingly, not only it was very bad (actually it was terrible), but the manager responses to the client comments were full of insults and threats.Now, as a former hotel General Manager, I know how frustrating it can be when you do your best and guests slash you on review sites anyway, but that is part of the game. At the end of the day, you will not be able to make everybody love you. That is true for anything in life. Therefore, the only thing you can do (unless the reviews are completely misleading, and in that case, you can always report them to the review site for further investigation and possible removal) is to swallow your ego, calm down and apologize.\n\nI was feeling bad for the owner of the pizzeria and I imagined him as a 70-something old school Naple guy that never get out of the pre-web era, so I tried to contact him privately to give him some advises because, with this approach, he was actually damaging his business (giving the F-word to a client is never a good idea). To my big surprise, when I finally reached him, I discovered that he was around my age and pretty familiar with social networks too.We had a long chat and I explained to him some best practices in order to deal with the (unavoidmakable) occasional bad reviews (all for free, of course). I didn’t really expect gratitude, and I did it just because I felt bad for the guy, but what he said to me at the end of the conversation shocked me: he accused me to work secretly for TripAdvisor and he told me that I wanted him to buy something from the famous review site. At that point, I stopped any kind of contact with him, as the whole situation was turning into an Illuminati-like conspiracy and I honestly did not want to waste more time on it.Nevertheless, this incident made me think about how restaurants and hotels managers underestimate the power of reviews when it comes to food & beverage.Within my clients, I have a hotel with an amazing two-Michelin-star restaurant but, even though they actively reply professionally to every single review published on the hotel review sites, the restaurant TripAdvisor page stays on an incredible state of abandonment. Even worse, whenever they receive a bad review, they try to report it in order to move it to the restaurant page. They use the restaurant review page as the hotel parachute. And we are talking about one of the best places you can eat in southern Italy.Sure, often hotel restaurants are forgettable (at best), overpriced and the majority of guests eat there as a last resort because the closest restaurant in town is half an hour Uber ride away, but does this mean that you have to give up managing your online reputation tout court? I doubt it.Listening to your guests is, as always, the golden rule. However, there is another one that’s often forgotten: when was the last time you ate at your restaurant? I am sure between your duties as a general manager you have to inspect rooms, meet your staff and speak to your attendants on a daily basis, but how much time do you spend in the kitchen?Everybody is complaining about the quality of the veggies on Yelp? Well, maybe it is time to change your distributors. The name of that rude F&B Manager pops out on every single review. I think you should have a chat vis-à-vis with him and solve the issue once for all.Hotel restaurants have the tendency of being seen as sons of a lesser God when it comes to hospitality: as long as rooms are clean and Wi-Fi works fine then there is no need to worry about the undercooked pasta. They are conceived as unanimated appendages to the main entity: the hotel. However, the reality is that they are not. Even though they do not necessarily reflect the hotel style and vibe, it does not mean they are just tools to make some ancillary revenue. Especially if your hotel is located far from the city center, it is vital that you give your guests a great experience. Would you risk destroying your hotel online reputation just because you serve watered down margaritas? I do not think so.\n\nGreat experience can mean good prices too. If you know that your restaurant is average, it can be a good idea to review your à-la-carte menu to make it look less like a robbery. Remember that with the rise of mobile and social networks your reputation is just one click away so sometimes listening to your clients when they are in the restaurant is not enough.Therefore, what you should do to actively monitoring your restaurant online reputation?We gathered 10 golden rules to improve your restaurant experience:So, is managing restaurant’s online reputation a priority for hotel general managers?\n\nIt surely is, if you focus & leverage on technology it can turn out to be a Secret Sauce in enhancing your Hotel Brand.For a 30 days free trial of our Online Reputation Management Tool, click here.Guests AuthorMr. Simone PuortoA passionate marketing geek since ’99, after managing two hotels, he moved to consulting and writing in the mid-’00s.

A hotel lacking behind in social strategy may be considered un-contemporary and may have potential chances of being overlooked while prospect makes booking online. Therefore, it becomes imperative for brands to have their social presence upright on all social media platforms disseminating consistent brand messaging and exhibiting features of their property.Social Media; a competition-monitoring platform.Doing business now is not just knowing what your customer thinks about your property & service, now it also extends to knowing what the consumers like about your competitor and what is your USP over your competitor’s. Customer feedback on various review websites and social media platforms can help you prepare counter mechanisms timely to tackle competitive moves. Social media is also a vital tool for competition monitoring and for comparing your competitor’s strength and weakness with yours. Brands can improvise from what their competitors have been doing wrong and have an edge over them at all times.Social Media; a customer reviews and service platformSocial media now plays a role of the effective online review platform by listing the experience voiced by the customer after and during the stay. Customers are actively using social media channels to get a prompt response to their complaints. Brands are very possessive about their online reputation management, and thus take utmost diligence in handling online guest reviews, especially negative reviews. There are numerous instances where bad reviews spread like fire and inflict serious injuries to brand image.Some of the brands have even started utilizing social media channels like Facebook messenger as a customer service tool, Hyatt being the pioneer in the list. Customers can directly message the brand using Facebook messenger without having to follow the brand. This creates a one to one prompt communication between the brand and the customer, bypassing obstructions like IVR and long waiting queues.Social Media; an advertisement and offers platform.Social Media has emerged as one of the most credible, affordable and realistic advertisement platforms in recent time with a myriad of advantages over other forms of advertising. Social Media has extended the power of advertising to brands of all sizes since it is extremely affordable as compared to other facets of paid advertising like print media, television and search engine advertising, etc.Social media is the best platform to disseminate any running offers.

Brands can provide a hyperlink in their postings to redirect traffic to the brand’s own website and ultimately increase direct bookings.Social Media; a relationship-building platformNot only engaging the present guests, but also maintaining a continual relationship with the past guests can yield fruitful results in the long run. Social media lets you do this for free by engaging your past audience in the form of guest feedback surveys and polls.

656328cea3f6fc78b8eba2b6,-1506879907,Top Trends: Millennial Travelers & the Hospitality Sector,"May 30, 2017","Who are Millennial Travelers & What Do They Like?The hospitality industry worldwide has come a long way, witnessing stupendous growth year on year and with revenues pouring inconsistently. The face of the industry has undergone massive transformation recently, owing to rapid advancement in technology and subsequently consumer behavior. Quite interestingly, the Millennial generation (it refers to the generation of people born anywhere between the early 1980s and early 2000) has been driving the industry with full force and swing and is urging the hotels across the globe to adopt newer ways and outlook to engage with the guests and leave aside the traditional norms of functioning.As a result, the hotels of today have evolved into unique high-tech destinations, promising to deliver a wow experience to this new generation of travelers. Research shows that the millennial travelers already make up for over one-third of the world’s hotel guests, with predictions that they will reach over 50 per cent by 2020. Quite true, they seem to be the show runners.Capitalizing on the growing trend, all the major hotel players are trying to catch the pulse of this stratum of the population, in order to keep running the show successfully and create a top-of-the-mind recall amongst them. Yes, many of the hotels are revisiting their marketing strategies and are trying to respond to Millennials’ needs by adding new features and services that appeal to their tastes.So, what would be the top millennial trends in the hospitality sector at present? Let us take a dig at it…Millennial travelers live in the world of technology and are always scouting for a hi-tech, seamless experience. Availability of free Wi-Fi plays a key role, as revealed by a report stating that 70.9% of Millennials consider free Wi-Fi as an important factor while choosing the hotel. Technology and the internet come into the picture as early as the planning stage, from checking out the best travel and hotel prices, among other things like guest reviews, etc. Millennial travelers like to search for places and food they can experience while on vacation and post their reviews and pictures while on their travel and post-travel about their overall experience.Talking about technology, superior mobile technology is undoubtedly a no-miss for the hotels. Mobile devices have become essential in the travel experience of millennial travelers for quite some time, where mobile check-ins and check-outs have already emerged as the popular trends in the industry.  These tiny devices are aiding Millennials in performing a large array of functions starting from the discovery, booking, mobile check-ins, Geo-location, special discount apps, payment, etc.Thus, a mobile-friendly hotel website, in such a case is not a new requirement at all; rather it is an elementary necessity for the successful running of hotels.For those who wish to win loyalty of millennial travelers, embracing this technology is on the topmost of the list.According to a recent study, 52% of Millennials use mobile devices to book hotels and more than 20% have used their mobile devices to check into a hotel. In the U.S., 29% of the Millennials reported already having paid for the hotel with a mobile device, and 44% expressed a desire to do so – clearly a big opportunity.Millennials are happy using technology and robotics assisting them in travel planning, before and during the stay, providing them all answers speedily, without any delay. The hospitality industry worldwide has already tasted the magic of automation in some way or the other, where human involvement has been minimized to a great extent for many of the functions like competitive price tracking, rate optimization, online reputation management, etc.Robotics, for example, has taken wings in various countries and is gradually being accepted by others as a vital order. As the dependence on digital devices increases significantly, technology is seen as a key investment area for all major hotel brands, and revenue managers have already stood up to make a note of the same.It is a widely acknowledged fact that social media has broken all barriers of communication, giving tremendous power in the hands of the traveler to influence others within a few seconds. Yes, it has given powers in the hands of the hotel too.A recent study pointed out that an astounding 60 million tweets have mentioned hotels, TripAdvisor recently announced that there are now over 500 million reviews on their platform and this could be positive or negative, good or bad, a make or break for hotels. The millennial traveler, with an utmost desire to e-share stuff with the masses, is glued to social media round the clock, where Facebook check-ins, posting reviews, concerns, problems, etc. are already flooding the social media channels in big numbers. Of course, hotels realize the importance of social media in managing their online reputation, boosting their occupancy rates and RevPAR, and therefore constantly monitor the medium to take instant and appropriate action.As the widespread use of technology has given birth to a new generation of traveler –the millennial travelers are also causing the birth of multiple millennial-inspired hotels, which are fully equipped with technology to woo this special stream of guests.

656328d1a3f6fc78b8eba2b8,-1818065758,Evolving Role Of Hotel Revenue Manager - Part 4,"May 26, 2017","Part 4 of 4All that Big Data Matters – Hoteliers, learn how to leverage this dataHospitality industry captures numerous data from various sources. Guests start leaving a data stream from the instant they start their search till the time they check out. Technology experts, as well as hotels are beginning to get deeper with turning that data into actionable insights. However, for many hotels, this data is still largely underused.In our previous blogs of this series, we have discussed the importance of choosing your comp-set wisely and the role of technology in evolving the role of Revenue Manager. In this final part, we shall be discussing the significance of Big Data in hospitality and shaping the role of a new age Revenue Manager.Getting meaningful insights from heaps of unstructured data that hotels have is a huge challenge. Deriving action worthy information from different sets of large data and trying to understand the relation between these data sets about the customer preferences is not easy.The ability to aggregate big data into meaningful insight helps hoteliers to provide unparalleled opportunities to improve existing guest services, create innovative marketing strategies, improve the efficiency of operations, and enhance the overall growth and profitability of the hotel.Facilitate data gathering: To start with, hotels should facilitate an environment for gathering data from their guests. But how can they do this? Simply by ensuring that guests have free Wi-Fi. This will help you to tap a lot of hidden potential. How?Almost every guest travels with at least one device (laptop, tablet or mobile), and it is said that only 1% of hotel guest fills the paper post –visit survey as compared to 21-30 % using mobile or similar devices. This stat explains the point clearly.We cannot ignore the fact that hotels need assistance to extract & exploit this data. Various technology vendors offer data and transform the data into something meaningful. For example, having a powerful channel manager can provide a wealth of information about your incoming reservations including Channel Booked, Length of Stay, Booking Window, etc. This will surely save hoteliers a considerable time and money, which otherwise would have been spent on huge IT infrastructure to get valuable information from huge data files.Let us have a look at what areas big data can be applied for generating better results for your hotel: Hotels can use this collated information for the future and can delight their guests by making suggestions based on their culinary likes and other such details like the choice of room and newspaper. Such an approach surely improves the travel experience for the guests and makes them more likely to return and resulting in higher customer loyalty.Utilize big data to devise more targeted marketing strategy: Hotels can use big data to come up with a much-targeted marketing approach for each customer segment type. Another approach is to tap guests spending more time on social media, with social media specific ads and campaigns.Using big data in an effective manner will help you optimize your marketing spends across different channels. Additionally, big data can help hotels identify the downsides too. This will help them recognize the areas they are losing their customers.Consider this example: Analysis of weblog will help identify the point where guests are abandoning your brand site to switch to your competitors. This can help hotels to identify the problem, look for a solution accordingly, and thus increase customer revenue.Big data for capacity planning: Hotels can utilize big data received from a variety of sources such as social media, user-generated content sites, reservation, and booking logs, call centre logs, emails, photos, videos etc. to make smarter strategies, more dynamic pricing decisions and optimized capacity planning. Most hotels lose money because of inaccurate capacity planning or incorrect demand prediction.The Challenges: The biggest challenge is to constantly derive relevant and actionable insights from loads of data generated every day from different sources.Traditional organizational set-up, adoption of new technology, skilled resources are some of the main challenges. The security concern is another threat to the collection of big data from the internet.Despite these threats, big data is here to stay and will evolve hospitality industry in a big way and continue to open up many opportunities for the hospitality industry to engage with customers, offer customized services and come up with a more targeted marketing approach.Whether you are an experienced Revenue Manager or a student looking to start a career in Revenue Management, understanding and incorporating the above shared 4 aspects to your everyday practice will help you become a tech savvy, modern Revenue Manager who is well-equipped to manage multiple aspects of the evolving role.",https://rategain.com/blog/evolving-hotel-revenue-manager-use-big-data/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog_img-764x382.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog_img-764x382.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,Online reputation management,Revenue Management,,,,0
656328d3a3f6fc78b8eba2ba,-1890344487,The Evolving Role of Revenue Managers - Part 3,"May 24, 2017","Part 3 of 4Hotels Choose your Competitive Set WiselySelecting competitive set wisely is important for any hotelier. However, with the ease of search for the consumer, the obvious comp set is not always the case. In part 1 and part 2 of this series, we have read about How Modern Revenue Managers Bid Adieu to Traditional Revenue Managers with Evolving Role of Hotel Revenue Managers and Moving The Technology Way… Are You Ready Hoteliers.In this part, let us talk about the importance of choosing your comp set wisely.Comp sets have become more dynamic nowHotels should consider all relevant factors including location, hotel size, star rating, published room rates, hotel type and brand affiliation as well as other not so obvious factors such as hotel guest sentiment, hotel facilities, and amenities, access to transportation, seasonality and mix of business.The three most common causes for competitive set selections include brand building, market positioning and performance bench-marking. Picking a fitting competitive set and evaluating this selection over time as market conditions change is a worthwhile undertaking.This should be done minimally 2 times per year where a hotel monitors fluctuation in the comp sets by identifying other hotels competing most directly for business based on the criteria mentioned above. This provides the chance to observe fluctuations in comp set, indicating that when market dynamics change, so the hotel’s comp set should change too. Shared below are the few pointers to keep in mind, while selecting your competitive set:Market segment: It is very important that hoteliers understand the business mix of their competitor to help them better understand which hotels are similar to their own and also help hotels identify where potential advantages may exist.Market size: It is a very critical job again and yet very important to decide your competition size (number). For price positioning and competitive price analysis, it is suggested to track more than just direct competitors, thus the number of properties in your comp-set needs to be carefully chosen. Following this, hotels are able to better understand market trends and, when required take appropriate action to moderate or control those trends to their own lead.Location factor: Proximity and location play an important role in encouraging more bookings. In addition, with the easy availability of internet, travellers now have easy access to details like location, room price, guest reviews, etc. broadening their criteria for search and booking options. Interestingly, at times, other factors such as online reputation & reviews, aesthetics, amenities and services can reduce the impact that mere location can have on guest selection.When choosing your comp-set, do consider hotels in your not so near vicinity as well.Competitive set selection should be based on several factors – all of which can be considered to varying degrees, depending on the specifics of any given situation. In the case of convention centre property, a relevant competitor may be in another city or even another region.Guest sentiment: Online reviews are a very valuable source of information for both, you and about your competitors.Spending time to read the guest reviews posted on popular OTA and review sites will provide actionable insights into the type of guests that are staying at various properties and also divulge what those guests are saying about their experiences (both positive and negative) at the competing properties.While doing your hotel guest survey, take notice of properties that consistently appear amongst the top of the natural display order on various OTA and Metasearch sites.Visit your competitors and potential competitors: Create a SWOT analysis of your comp set by physically visiting them and evaluating their service, amenities, location, online reviews, etc. However, you need to evaluate them from the unbiased approach and a fresh set of eyes. You may discover some new additions to your list of competitors and find some of them irrelevant in your current list.Average rate/Price range theory: This is another very common and essential basis for choosing your comp set.For most guests, their decision to book is based on a specific price range including a ceiling price. The guest will not prefer to pay above the ceiling price if they have a sound option available in the same location. This guest price range can change over time, based on economic circumstances and also guest’s taste preferences may change.We cannot ignore the role of brand value, star rating and guest reviews in influencing whether or not a particular price point is acceptable to guest for a specific property.Considering the fact that properties in a given vicinity are not likely to be uniform with respect to their size & segment, channel mix, room type & room mix, sales tactic, price positioning and management effectiveness.Probably this will answer questions like why a mid-level hotel’s ADR might consistently outperform a full-service property in the same market.Assessing the competitive strength and your own: Being aware of the positives about your comp set is an advantage. It helps you compare your strengths and weaknesses against your competitors. However, when evaluating attributes, place them by weighing them in relation to the influence they may have in attracting and retaining certain customer segments.This practice above will enable you to eliminate or include hotels for consideration as you select your primary competitive set as well as develop secondary or dynamic competitive sets.Stay tuned for the last part of this series, where we will talk about How Hoteliers Should Leverage Big data.",https://rategain.com/blog/evolving-role-revenue-managers-hotel-comp-set/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Competitive-Edge-119382113-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Competitive-Edge-119382113-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,Rate shopping,,,,0
656328d6a3f6fc78b8eba2bc,667712582,The Evolving Role Of Hotel Revenue Managers – Part 2,"May 17, 2017","Part 2 of 4Moving The Technology Way… Are You Ready Hoteliers?Hotels nowadays are capitalizing on the use of hotel technology tools to deliver unique experiences to customers. In part 1 of this blog series, we discussed about How Modern Revenue Managers Bid Adieu to Traditional Revenue Managers with Evolving Role of Hotel Revenue Managers.Comparing the past and the present brings a little smirk to our faces when we think about how much information about guests and prospective guests we can collect using the latest in technology. The consumer has always been at the heart of the industry; however, finding ways to achieve a high level of guest satisfaction and to meet the raised expectations have clearly evolved.The expectations of excellent service and unique experiences is the new norm from the consumer.  Hotels are more than ever exploring this new standard by leveraging the use of technology to find innovative ways to interact and provide personalized, unique experiences. Technology is opening the gates for them to connect with the guest well before they even arrive at the property.The story does not end here. The relationship with the guests is not dismissed once they check out of the hotel. Long-term relationships are the key to growth, and proper means must be established to keep the doors of communication open. The data that hotels collect on guest preferences is stored permanently by the hotel, which allows them to offer better rewards in future, create custom itineraries, and present tailor-made offers going forward.Data on consumer insights is at the forefront of creating a solid hotel sales strategy. Much of this data is collected through various channels like social media, hotel review websites, google analytics and the latest in new technologies developed specifically for hotels. OTA partners are another wonderful source for this information. If you are not doing it already, ask your market manager or pull this information directly from the extranet to give you deeper insight. You might be surprised by what you see and adjust your strategy accordingly. With the amount of data available to hoteliers today, you should have a very good idea of your business and with this an improved decision-making and more precise hotel room price optimization and revenue management strategies.The rapid evolution of mobile phones is another hot medium for the interaction between hoteliers and guests. The current era has been rightly termed as the mobile era, where we all are so conveniently dependent on these tiny devices for almost anything and everything. Hotels have been offering a host of facilities to their guests, which are accessible right through their mobile phones. Technology has allowed these devices to be used as room keys by the guests, where they are able to check in straight through their mobile app, without having to stop and spend a few minutes at the front desk. And then, when the lights are turned on, technology assures them the most satisfying and personalized journey, a journey that promises to create some well cherished memories. Imagine this – at the time of check-in, the name of the guest appears on the screen along with a welcome message. Pretty cool!Though the power of technology is being significantly harnessed to enhance guest experience, the role of human touch in the hospitality industry can never be undermined. Nothing can replace the act of a relationship manager coming to greet the guests wearing a pleasant smile on the face.Thus, as it is important to put guest-centric processes and technology in place, it is equally important to have an enthusiastic hotel staff on the floor to fulfil the requirements of the guests and make them feel special. Yes, let the trip begin!Watch out for the part 3 of this series, where we will talk about Choosing Your Competitive Set Wisely",https://rategain.com/blog/evolving-role-hotel-revenue-managers-part2/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-165382157-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-165382157-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,Online reputation management,Revenue Management,,,,0
656328d9a3f6fc78b8eba2be,-1438689423,How Your Hotel distribution & Online Reputation Strategy is key to RevPAR Management,"May 15, 2017","Think of a time when you want to buy something that you have been wanting for a long time. Did you do enough research and due diligence? Now that you are nodding your head in agreement, think about the sources of your research; friends & family and internet would be the top two go to source for information, suggestion, and reconfirmation.Similarly, planning a vacation or a business trip is super important to people. While vacation planning is a fun activity, most travelers take it very seriously and want to ensure that they get the best of all worlds during the time off their mundane routine. Hence, booking a great hotel for their stay is a crucial component of this phase. The good thing from a traveler’s perspective is there are a wide variety of choices available in each budget segment. The difficult thing is to shortlist and choose one hotel. Research and due diligence take the front seat here!One of the major sources for travelers to either discover or carry out due diligence on your hotel is online via travel review sites like TripAdvisor. The fact that TripAdvisor recently announced that there are now over 500 million reviews on their platform is a testimonial to the growing importance of managing good online reputation for hoteliers. Even all OTAs today provide the ability for travelers to add reviews and rating on their platform to help guests make a quick and informed decision.More than 50% of TripAdvisor users say they will not book a hotel if it has no reviews according to research carried out by the company. The PhoCusWright study reveals TripAdvisor 87% of users feel more confident in their decision when they read the reviews and 98% quoted they find them ‘accurate of the actual experience’Table of ContentsWhat does this mean for your hotel? Well, essentially two things –1) It is important to be online and discoverable on all online hotel channels including OTAs, Metasearch sites, travel review sites etc.2) It is even more important to track, monitor and improve online reputation for your hotel.In essence, both won’t work well in absence of either or if you don’t use powerful technology to make this process automated, faster & effective. Hotel distribution and online reputation strategy must work in tandem to ensure RevPAR management.The well-known tool; Channel Management/OTA management in the Hotel IndustryWith Emerging Role of Hotel Revenue Managers, amongst other emerging roles and tasks, hotel channel management is one of the most valuable functions today. We all will agree to this as the need for continuously updating the hotel’s inventory across all distribution channels has become of immense importance. A recent study by Phocuswright reveals that between 61-75% of travelers in the developed markets use an OTA to book their hotel, which makes it clear why employing a hotel channel manager software is utmost important and will also provide a big opportunity for booking number expansion. Hoteliers today clearly see how automated distribution systems improve their revpar management, enhancing their yield manifold.The function has greatly matured over the years, where a few clicks can give you a panoramic vision of the whole inventory, enabling rooms to be displayed on different portals simultaneously.Well, we have already bid adieu to the manual ways of management. With increasing demands and dynamic nature of this business, it was a big challenge to ensure an accurate display of inventory and the rates across all platforms, which at times lead to confusion and difficulty in optimizing each channel diligently. The role of a hotel channel manager, therefore, becomes crucial.Automation has emerged as the new order of the day. A hotel channel manager, through centralized management, ensures that as soon as a room is booked through any of the OTAs, the availability is automatically reduced across all channels, which helps in avoiding overbooking and any other kind of issues that might arise.Online Reputation Manager; Your compulsory Friend to Increase Hotel BookingsOf late, the hospitality industry has made its way into the big world of online reputation management, where improving reviews and ratings in the online space play an extremely big role. A recent report reveals that 59% of travelers feel review sites and social media has the maximum influence on their booking decisions, and 50% of the guests will not book a room in a hotel that has no reviews.Clearly, hoteliers are left with no choice, but sit up and keep a check on how their brand is being portrayed in the online world. Moreover, think about developing an appropriate guest survey strategy to keep same in your favor. Yes, it is important to convey to your guests that you care. Moreover, monitoring guest feedback system will also provide valuable insights for your business and determine areas where you could improve your services. All this helps build a bright image of the hotel in the long term and boosting revpar management of the hotel.Now, since the reviews are posted on multiple sites, it might be a little trouble to manually view all of them and to make sure that none goes unattended. This is again, where technology comes to your rescue and saves the day for you.There are ORM tools available to collect and aggregate review scores from multiple online sources. Hoteliers can easily track their average online review scores, along with the scores of the competition. Any necessary adjustments can then be made to the hotel operations, based on the findings.How Channel Manager and Online Reputation Manager Go Hand in Hand The digital age of today demands utmost attention from the industry, as we see the image of the hotels being mostly created or destroyed on social media and review site, which seems to have the power to make or break.Nevertheless, hoteliers need not worry as technology helps you here too. In such a scenario, a combination of a channel manager and an online reputation manager is what you need. A miss in any of these tools could be a danger alarm for the future of the hotels. Without fail, such a strategy will work wonders with the hotel’s RevPAR management and maximise revenue.Interestingly, while most hotels do have a channel manager for distributing their inventory online, they seem to conveniently ignore or stay oblivious to the fact that travelers who will come to book your hotel on an OTA site will also look for guest reviews of your hotel, underestimating the potential returns from the same. Little do they realize that poor online reputation management could greatly damage the identity of the hotel, causing some serious booking losses. While some Revenue Managers feel that managing guest reviews is a complicated affair, where there is already the availability of advanced software, which allows you to easily collate reviews to give you a score.It becomes the natural priority of a hotel to maximise its revenue from all the sales channels, which is incomplete without positive guest feedback. With growing digitisation of hospitality sector, Hotel distribution & Online Reputation Strategy is key to RevPAR Management.While a channel manager ensures management of inventory in the most dynamic way in the online world, an online reputation manager can control what the world has to say about the hotel in the most dignified way. Both, together, can fuel the hotel bookings and pave way for hotel’s success.For a 30 days free trial of our Online Reputation Management Tool, click here.",https://rategain.com/blog/revpar-management-hotel-distribution-reputation-strategy/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-184358374-3000x1500-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-184358374-3000x1500-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Distribution,Guest feedback,hotel channel manager,Online reputation management,,,,0
656328dba3f6fc78b8eba2c0,856141515,The Evolving Role of Hotel Revenue Managers - Part 1,"May 10, 2017","Part 1 of 4Modern Revenue Managers Bid Adieu to Traditional Revenue ManagersThe progression of the hospitality industry has transformed the revenue management as a central discipline in the hotel. Hotels of today are striving hard to gain more profitability by implementing the latest revenue management strategies and technologies which involve much more than just inventory and hotel price optimisation.The role of revenue managers today, has amplified substantially to include a variety of other important tasks including online marketing, social media and online reputation management, channel management and the focus on TRM (Total Revenue Management) just to name a few. Consequently, the revenue manager of today is required to wear multiple hats at the same time and possess more skills than ever before to succeed in this challenging and dynamic role.What we see today from cutting-edge revenue management leaders is the development and implementation of inventive marketing strategies focused on attracting guests from different key segments. A systematic approach is being followed for the development of targeted propositions across the hotel’s website, distribution channels, e-marketing and offline channels. Most certainly, this leads to smarter and more profitable revenue generation, but must be implemented and executed carefully, including cross functions of the hotel as well as carefully consider the bigger distribution landscape.Social media and Online Reputation Management for hotels is also at the forefront of the revenue management role, having a noteworthy impact on the hotel ADR. Hotel revenue managers have delved deep down in the role by ensuring continuous engagement with the audience on all platforms in the form of creative posts, contests, and other activities. All kind of reviews and recommendations posted on these platforms should be actively looked into by the revenue manager and taken into consideration when creating the value proposition for potential guests.This is why the need for a reliable Online Reputation management tool is so important. Revenue management leaders must work closely with operations to ensure that guest expectations are met, guest feedback in being handled correctly and continuous improvements are being made to achieve an optimal guest sentiment score.The hotel revenue managers of today are busy performing numerous roles – talking to guests, determining innovative pricing strategies, analysing competition performance and trends, identifying new markets and ways to drive more business, managing the digital presence of the hotel, driving online distribution, and a lot more with the broader objective of TRM or total revenue management.In this highly connected age, technology has reshaped consumer behavior and revenue experts are seen adopting a more holistic approach to their strategies.To summarise, revenue management is a well-defined success story, which will continue to thrive and expand in the future. The modern revenue manager seems to have come a long way in today’s technology-driven environment and still continues to move ahead.As the practice of revenue management continues to integrate with the key functions of the hotel, the need for a thorough understanding of the market landscape becomes crucial for these multi-functional experts. The job continues to become more dynamic, revenue managers!Considering the above, is the title Revenue Manager even relevant anymore?

656328dda3f6fc78b8eba2c2,-1805127931,5 Effective Ways Hotels Could Conduct Guest Surveys and Loyalty Programs,"May 2, 2017","For long, getting to know what hotel guests want has been every hotelier’s bugbear. Ambivalent, unclear suggestions from customers impede hoteliers’ ability to take concrete steps to improve their services. Moreover, in this era of price-oriented competition among hotels, price sensitive travellers; garnering loyal guests become challenging, necessitating the use of specific tools aimed at overcoming these problems.Effective Guest SurveysComprehensive guest surveys help to obtain and analyse customer feedback. Let us look at ways we can carry out effective surveys.The good-old questionnaires about the guests’ hotel experience may not be the most effective feedback gathering approach in today’s time.\n\nGuests are usually asked to fill those forms at checkout when a guest has already experienced a problem that could have been prevented.Moreover, the intrinsic unresponsiveness of guests generates a less-than-authentic feedback. Hence, direct communication between guests and managers helps the latter know about customer’s needs and complaints, if any. Thus, it is advisable that hotels should ask for feedback during the guest stay.Overwhelming the customer with a repertoire of comment cards and online forms and social media review request is not a good idea, especially when people in general are bombarded with lots of communication all through their day. Since all the travelers are tech savvy now, you can easily do away with physical feedback forms and stick to Online Guest Survey Forms. You can get plenty of useful information with just one or two tools.You can get the guests to reveal much more specific information about their stay experience in personal interactions than on a piece of paper or online forms. This increases the survey authenticity and helps the hotel staff also assure the guest that their problem will be looked into immediately.Appealing, engaging and interactive forms increase the likelihood of guests responding to them comprehensively. Hotel technology vendors are offering specific solutions to address this, where hotels can customise their own feedback forms and in their preferred language too with Guest Feedback Survey. Such tools also help hoteliers evaluate their guest’s loyalty through Net Promoter Score (NPS).Additionally, understanding the importance of online guest reviews, guest can now also choose to publish their survey response on Google Reviews.“Customer Service is an Attitude, Not a Department”. Develop the culture of customer service in your hotel. This attitude should be imbibed in all of your staff members. Since your staff gets to interact the most and closely with your guests, it is a great idea to seek their inputs regarding general issues brought to them by the guests. This enhances the scope and authenticity of the survey. Further, empower your staff to take decision to solve the issue at the ground level itself, preventing any further aggravation of the issue and upset the guest even more.Fruitful Loyalty ProgramsA 2014 study by Cornell University, Center for Hospitality Research Publications reported a revenue increase of up to 50 percent for hotels whose guests joined their loyalty programs. That is a good enough reason to leverage them. But, how? Let us find out!A complex reward system with not-so-convenient redemption like bringing more customer references to your hotel may discourage customers and hence, bring few benefits out of the loyalty/reward program.Efforts for customer’s end should be as simple as sharing your hotel’s listing on social media or buying non-room services for reward points. This encourages more guests to enrol in loyalty programs than otherwise.The most common rewards in guest loyalty programs are discounted rates for the subsequent stays. But, these rewards do not create great value for irregular visitors.What you can do to make your rewards more ‘pronounced’ is offering quick benefits like free club passes, meal discounts and cashback offers, etc.Data regarding the length of stays, frequency of visits by different guests helps you craft customized offers and schemes for individual guests. You can also use data to focus more on frequent visitors to develop long-term relationships and more customised loyalty program for them.If the staff personally approaches the customers to sign up for loyalty programs, it conveys a genuine concern for the guests and makes them more receptive to offers.A 2015 study by Software Advice Research revealed that 58% of the participating Millennials found hotel loyalty apps valuable.It is likely for the guests to seek quick access to information regarding their rewards. Having a hotel loyalty program app immensely aids this purpose.Today’s day and age witnesses abrupt and dramatic changes in guest preferences. Employing strategically crafted survey mechanisms and guest loyalty programs can help hotels leverage the trend changes and stay forward in the game.",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-hotels-guest-surveys-loyalty-programs/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Business-Man-Select-Happy-156570752-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Business-Man-Select-Happy-156570752-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
656328e0a3f6fc78b8eba2c4,1820750799,"Hoteliers, Are Vacation Rentals Eating Your Lunch?","April 26, 2017","In 1975, a Kodak employee named Steven Sasson showed his invention of the digital camera to his bosses. Fearing it would eat up their film sales, they dismissed the idea of manufacturing it for the masses. In 2012, Kodak filed bankruptcy, for they were too late to embrace a potentially advantageous change and leverage opportunities therefrom. They failed to learn from their competitors.August 2008 marked the arrival of a similar threat to the hospitality and tourism industry with the arrival of Vacation Rentals, with their unique hospitality services of short-term lodging and home-stays. Several vacation rental startups like Airbnb, HomeAway, OneFineStay have entered the market since, bringing about a revolutionary change in the lodging market and giving hoteliers a tough time coping with the consequential reduction in their market share.Change in a business environment can be daunting at the outset, especially so if it is as dramatic as the case above. Nevertheless, it comes with a set of hidden opportunities, and businesses must identify them to take things in their stride. The same applies to the hotel industry. But first, we need to study the challenge in detail.How are vacation rentals affecting the hotel industry?Let us look at some figures about the impact the lodging alternatives have had on an otherwise well-established hotel industry.• According to the STR report published in 2017 analyzed data of the most successful vacation rental platform, Airbnb, from 13 countries over a span of three years and revealed that available units for the said vacation rental increased by up to 100% in some cases.• According to the STR report, 2 out of the 13 countries studied witnessed a decrease in hotel demand corresponding to an increase in that of vacation rental services. In addition, hotel rates in NYC witnessed a drop of 1.7% in 2015.• From 3000 listings in 2009, popular vacation rentals flaunt more than a whopping 2.3 million in 2017.• The majority of vacation rental guests are leisure-inclined, which is betokened by the trend of higher bookings on weekends as opposed to weekdays when most business-related travel takes place. This raises concerns for hoteliers, as leisure-oriented travel has always been a high-performing area for hotels. And they now have someone to compete with in that aspect too!• Another stark secret is that vacation rentals are not just about leisure-related travel! 10% of visits are reported to be business-oriented, a segment hotel industry had almost monopolized until now.These figures effectively signal the dent vacation rentals continue to have on the hospitality industry.\n\nWe approached Mr. Petr Šalda, General Manager Grandhotel Zvon, for his take on this new industry dynamics. In his opinion, any industry with limited competition becomes self-satisfied and stunted. In my opinion, internet technology brought a fresh wind into a backwater and what we see is a lively new market emerging with very low entry barriers. Everyone can try, everyone can bring new ideas. Hotels mingling on the same market with vacation rentals and chic apartments are not necessarily a bad thing as they make for plenty of consumer choice and boundless inspiration for creative hoteliers.This new development might have empowered small, nimble and technology-savvy properties at the costs of big traditional hotels, but for those with the fresh attitude, it only created yet another exciting opportunity. Who says the market should stay the same?How can hotels cope with the challenge?The challenge though distant is big enough to take hotel revenue generation for a ride.\n\nLet us study ways to overcome the challenges brought about by vacation rentals’ phenomenal market presence.• Data extraction and analysis: Why are cab giants like Uber so successful without spending millions on data extraction technology? Because they invest the right way—from start to end. Each and every stage of the guest’s journey is recorded, right from booking times to stay destinations. This helps them tremendously in market targeting and segmentation. Hotels can use the same technology to get more information about the demographics of their guests and target their guests better. This way, it will be easier to find and focus on the customers who are likely to prefer hotels to homestays.• Provide an authentic experience: Yours is not a vacation rental. However, you can emulate the homestay experience in your hotel itself! Several surveys have revealed that guests these days seek an authentic experience, courtesy the popular ‘digital detox’ trend. This is probably partly why vacation rentals appeal to the masses. Hence, stressing over extreme automation of services may need a break, and a strategy to make the guests ‘feel at home’ needs a push. To exemplify, creating home-like ambiances like mini gardens and room-attached kitchens would be a plus. While the peril of loss of hotel restaurant revenue due to attached kitchens may concern you, understand that it is much more profitable than losing a guest to a vacation rental service!• Rev up your feedback mechanism: The service rating system in terms of ‘star points’ employed by Airbnb after the completion of each stay helps them assess guest satisfaction with barely any investment. Hotels can learn from this and benefit in terms of feedback analysis and simplification of the review system.• Market what you do best: Service! That is what hotels do. No domestic bedroom accommodation can match the level of service a hotel can deliver. Hotels also offer the advantage of often being situated in ideal city locations, which makes a great positive difference in the overall stay experience of the guests. Market your strengths in customer service more than you would market your room designs and swimming pools to achieve better prospects of occupancy, for quality service is appreciated everywhere.\n\nSuiteness.com offers an online platform where hotels can offer families and groups the facility to book connected rooms and services, something most hotels have been unable to deliver independently. Hotels can proactively use platforms like these to generate more hotel revenue.• Push for more business-oriented visits: As discussed earlier, hotels still dominate the business-oriented guests’ segment. With countries as small as Israel churning out the largest number of startups every year, business-related travel is bound to be on the rise. Through marketing targeted at business-oriented guests, customized to boost occupancy from the said segment, hotels can stay at the top of their game.Stale environment corrupts minds on both the supply and demand side of the equation and discourages talent. On the other hand, you can go ahead, meet the challenge and take one more look at your traditional property.\n\nCan it not be rebranded, part of it refurbished to modern apartments more to the taste of contemporary traveler and the full potential of your highly specialized team (that most of the small properties and vacation rentals don’t have) turned towards mining this exciting new market? Can you not upgrade the technology and let vacation rentals data pour into your revenue management analyses?Everyone is trying to eat your lunch on the digital marketplace. I say let us face this interesting challenge and utilize its potential to grow your business in unexpected ways, concluded Peter.No doubt, the rise of vacation rentals has made the hospitality more competitive than ever, signaling an impending hollow in hotel revenues. Technology solution providers are also wakening up to this new change and are offering solutions which are providing insight about vacation rental giants like Airbnb. Their solutions are offering Intelligence on overall Airbnb market supply & average market rate for your city.Hence, hoteliers must overcome this threat by proactively finding and leveraging opportunities in the competition, learning from their competitors’ strategies and capitalizing on their strengths.\n\nAs long as hoteliers can do that while avoiding the mistakes Kodak continued to make for almost three decades, they can have their way. So gear up, hoteliers. Change is good!!!Guest Contribution",https://rategain.com/blog/vacation-rentals-eating-hotel-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vacation-rental_airbnb-1428x714-1024x512-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vacation-rental_airbnb-1428x714-1024x512-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/peterSalda-150x150-1.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,Vacation Rentals,,,,0
656328e4a3f6fc78b8eba2c6,1820225201,The Future of Hotel Revenue Management – BOTs or Humans?,"April 18, 2017","The Hotel Revenue management role is continuously evolving, getting more comprehensive with time, as they now delve down into various key functions, wearing multiple hats at a time. However, as technology continues to make a deeper impact in our lives lending a complete makeover to the industry, the question arises whether revenue managers would continue to play the leading role that they do now? Alternatively, are they going are going to evolve into an even more important role or be simply replaced by technology? Let us take a dig at it…Artificial Intelligence Powered RobotsArtificial Intelligence has already taken over the hospitality industry by a huge storm. Hotels across the globe have been adopting some exciting and unique ways to streamline their functions and move ahead at a faster pace. Interestingly, many have started experimenting with robots, with a large number of countries already going head over heels for robotics. Besides using them for guest interactions and concierge-type services, these astute machines are aiding the revenue leaders in hotel bookings, transactions, managing demand and capacity in the hotels, and a whole lot of other things. Being able to break down complex data into interesting insights and trends, these industrial-strength machines efficiently arrive at optimum room prices with a lot of ease and speed.Forward-thinking hotels across the globe are therefore increasingly basing their strategies on advanced solutions provided by BOTs.Robots are powered to do much more; these futuristic machines are introducing an enormous value to the world of revenue management. Besides determining prices, the automation-driven robots squeeze the data to identify the target market segments, help the management device specific promotional activities catering to different segments, and suggest if any discounts or specialty room rates should be introduced for some of them.Providing a critical analysis of the industry trends and demand factors, the robots could generate consolidated revenue reports, through which an appropriate forecast for pricing could be made. Hotels that have not yet toyed with the idea of using these magical devices, would find it strange to see the revenue per available room numbers splash on their own.Adoption of Robotics WorldwideRobotics, though at a fairly nascent stage, has already brought waves of change to the hotel operations worldwide, with Japan as a clear world leader in adopting robotics technology. A new survey of 6,000 travelers in Asia, Europe, North America and South America conducted by Travelzoo reveals that 80% of travelers expect robots to play a big part in their lives by 2020 and that they are mostly comfortable with the idea that robots will play a role in their holidays.According to the survey, German and French respondents were the least enthusiastic, while Chinese and Brazilians most positive about how robotics could enhance their travel experience. Clearly, the introduction of robots is a welcome move as far as the hotel operations are concerned. For revenue management, we are yet to see the results.The Future of Revenue ManagementThe industry sits back and ponders – are the robots going to steal the show from the hands of revenue managers, putting their roles in jeopardy? The answer is, NO. Though these nimble, sci-fi, revolutionary machines intelligently squash out all the necessary data and details to arrive at the best possible solution in no time, the question arises is that the best possible solution always ready to be implemented in all cases?We reached out to experts from the Hospitality Industry to gather their opinion on this burning subject.Mr. Kiran Suthar, Director of Revenue Management and E- Commerce, Kupu Kupu Resorts, shared his valuable insights on the subject. “Earlier days Revenue Manager used to manage the OTA and Website and do the yielding exercise; after some time Revenue Managers started managing Groups and Banqueting. Then they have started analyzing Room + F & B Revenues and after then they became Total Revenue Managers analyzing, Managing and Developing revenues for Room+ F& B + SPA+ MODS. The Current Role of Revenue Manager is very active with Total Revenue Management + Digital Marketer + Opportunity Seeker + Business Analysis”.Adding further he said, “The Role of BOTS in Hotel Revenue Management is nowadays getting more important as most of the travelers or major share of travelers are Millennial; BOTS are like robots in digital display page who boosts the popularity or increases the search results, it also helps scripts to play its role effectively. If in Hotel Revenue management the BOTS are used wisely and with the balanced sequence, you can lead your competition and get the higher visibility and your chance of getting booked can be increased, increasing your hotel profitability. BOTS are like normal Robots you need to program them very well to function properly”.We contacted Mr. Kunwardeep Singh, Manager Customer Success, RateGain, and an Ex-Revenue Manager, Taj, and Oberoi, about his views on this topic. As per him, “BOTS/Technology will understand inputs the way they are, for example for a BOT/Tool, conference means same and would consider the equal loss in materialization. However, a Revenue Manager knows the difference between a Pharma conference and a Dealer conference and can predict the wash better than technology. However, to make his life easier, technology can give revenue managers a starting point to know history and develop his decision on top of that using his instincts and emotional level. There would be a clash many times, and the decisions given by the revenue manager would most likely take the lead”.Adding further, Miss Karen Pawlikowski, a seasoned industry expert said, “This is where human expertise and intelligence comes into the picture and makes it clear that the role of hotel revenue managers would continue to remain untouched in the days to come. The revenue managers take into account various external factors like recent developments in the hospitality industry, new hotel coming into the locality, etc. which the system might not be aware of, and would greatly affect decision-making. For example, there would be times when the BOTs suggest a price hike, and the revenue managers suggest the prices to remain unchanged basis his understanding and information available outside the system”.BOTs, powered by artificial intelligence, are definitely the next big thing in the field of hotel revenue management. By efficiently taking away most of the tasks performed by the revenue managers, these machines would most likely free them from some crucial responsibilities, helping them focus on other vital functions, where human involvement is essential. The modern day revenue managers are already aware of the challenging times ahead. They seem to be engaged in pulling multiple gears to add more value to the system, as their role demands muech more now. Surely, they need to be more evolved, learned and well-informed, having the technology by their side to facilitate them in decision making.Having said this, the future certainly looks to be different.  A human brain and intelligence have no substitute in this world, and the reasons for this are many. The creativity and experience that it can bring forth, can do wonders and revolutionize the working of any industry beyond boundaries.Thus, in an ideal futuristic scenario, we see BOTs as a great counterpart to revenue managers, which need to have the guiding hands of humans to ensure the best growth-oriented results. Hotel Revenue Management, if driven by both BOTS and seasoned Revenue Manager’s simultaneously, would put the hotel on the path to success.Guests Contribution  ",https://rategain.com/blog/future-hotel-revenue-management-bots-humans/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/artificial-intelligence-risk-reward-now-labs-2088x1044.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/artificial-intelligence-risk-reward-now-labs-2088x1044.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kiran2.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Karen-2.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/k_deep.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Revenue Management,Robotics,,,,,,0
656328e7a3f6fc78b8eba2c8,-2091802741,"Hoteliers, Learn How to Overcome the Challenges in Online Reputation Management","April 14, 2017","In the hospitality industry, the importance of superior guest service is unquestionable. It is self-explanatory why the industry is focusing a lot on measuring the consequence of their guest service in the form of guest reviews and feedback. Particularly when it has a direct impact on your hotel returns.Technology solution vendors are offering a plethora of tools and solutions to the hospitality industry for managing Guest Experience and their Online Reputation Management (ORM). Through these tools and guest feedback, hotels are empowered to identify their areas of improvement, their strength, and weaknesses Vis-a-Vis their competition.Since ORM is extremely crucial, it has to be done with utmost care. The awareness about ORM is growing, with a large number of hotels taking it up seriously. However, there are still many hotels that are closed to this growing trend, and it would be some time until ORM becomes the topmost priority of all.Hotels face some challenges in online reputation management. Some of the common key challenges hotels need to overcome are –A recent research reveals that 87% of travelers had an improved opinion of a hotel if they read an appropriate management response to bad reviews. However, though we see leading hotels who have appointed experts to attend to such important matters, we see others adopting a very casual way towards the same, which in most cases, upsets the guest even more. Hotels must educate their staff on the right kind of message that they would want to send out to their guests, to make sure that none gets offended.Technology solutions also empower hoteliers to translate the guest reviews and respond to them in your preferred language. This is a very useful feature from the perspective that your guests are global and hotels are also operating from different geographies. Online Reputation Management has grown to become a necessity in the world of hospitality, rather than remaining as a choice function. Let us wait for the future to take control, when ORM would be more evolved than now, having a broader role to play. It is important for the hospitality industry to take note of the challenges in online reputation management that many hoteliers face during implementation, in order to enhance the guest experience, achieve overall operational excellence and drive more revenues. ",https://rategain.com/blog/overcome-shortcomings-challenges-in-online-reputation-management/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Business-Or-Marketing-Concept-181728700-1-617x308.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Business-Or-Marketing-Concept-181728700-1-617x308.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0

In the last part of this blog series, we will discuss Targeted Email Marketing to Drive More Business During Lower Seasons.A great way to run offers and promotions is to target past guests of your hotel. In order to do this, you must be sure to collect the email id of each guest that had stayed at your hotel. Two ways to go about doing this are –ORRemember you must obtain the guest permission for email marketing so ensure that you give them this option to receive promotional emails from the hotel.Once you have a solid database built, consider whom you want to target and how you want to construct the offer. Consider directing these offers at leisure or business guests that can reach your hotel by driving, train or short travel distances. You could also consider creating weekday and weekend offers to entice both types of guests.Next, you need to consider what types of inclusions and value adds (as discussed in Part 3 of the series) you want to include in the offer. Ensure that you change the offer often enough to impact all of your seasons. During higher demand, seasons consider creating offers that include F&B and Spa components or upgraded room types. Obviously, in the lower seasons, use discounts and value adds to make the overall offer attractive.Encourage your staff to collect as much information about the guests profile as possible. Marketing is much easier when you have collected certain demographics of the guests such as;Having this information can give you more power to personalize offers.Lastly and very importantly, you will want to track the success of the email campaign. Track all opens, click-through, inquiries and bookings stemming from your emails, which is easily done through an automated email marketing system.

The more you can offer, the more attractive the offer will be.Remember as always when putting these offers in place be sure to launch them in time to impact the desired stay dates.

Many of us still work from excel sheets and although we are able to achieve great results for our hotels, we wonder… if I was able to automate part of this processes, could I free up more time to focus on pushing my strategies to market and increase my revenue? In today´s highly competitive market, two very sure ways to become market leaders are:ANDIn order to accomplish the above two points, it´s critical that some manual processes are automated. Translating data to actions generally flows in the following way:Collect > Organize > Analyse > Decision Making > ACTIONFinding a system that can bypass the first 3-4 steps would save us an enormous amount of time to put actions into place.Gaining competitive intelligence is one of, if not the most important part of becoming a market leader. However, how can we use point 1 from above to make sense out of the competitive intelligence we receive?Looking solely at competitor rates is not enough. Having an overall Benchmark rate takes that to the next level and even better than that, being able to give each competitor a certain % weight against our hotel could be even better. The below chart shows you an example of what I am referring to. Hotels often have 5-10 competitors however not each of those hotels hold the same relevance. Being able to make a weight % against your selected competitive set will give even more precision to your rate strategy.Another extremely important point to consider when pricing is the perceived value against your competitors. We often have a hard time to calculate this when making our pricing decisions. With the guest sentiment being a hugely important part of the guest decision process, we cannot exclude this from the equation. A tool that aggregates this data from the various review/OTA sites and gives us a value index against our guests is the answer! What if that same tool was able to take the competitive pricing data from above, combined with other relevant factors to give you an optimal sell rate? This is the perfect example of translating valuable data into meaningful actions.The above are just a few examples of how technology can provide you with meaningful data. With the time saved on the collecting, organizing and analysing the data, we have much more time for Decision Making and Actions.

656328fda3f6fc78b8eba2d6,45452354,Revenue Management & Marketing Automation can Help Independent Hotels Stay Ahead,"March 14, 2017","Years of meticulous planning on marketing, quality service, and an efficient revenue management strategy must have brought the likes of Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt from independent hotel start-ups to world’s leading hotel chains. However, the popularity and influence of hotel chains make it harder for today’s independent hotels to compete. A phocuswright study revealed that until 2015, hotel chains have been growing thrice as fast as independents!The obvious challenge is that independent hotels have fewer resources, less brand recognition and a limited budget to invest in high-end technology. Many independent hotels also lack a dedicated revenue management staff, which is why the need for an effective revenue and hotel management strategy becomes a pressing one. Can revenue management address independent hoteliers’ most common challenges?Table of ContentsLet us look at some plausible ways.Prioritize GOPPAR over Occupancy:In the era of competitive pricing, it is the Gross Operating Profit per Available Room (GOPPAR) that wins maximum Average Daily Revenue (ADR), not occupancy. A hotel with 78% occupancy with higher room rates may drive in more revenue than another hotel that settled for low-rate business just to achieve 100% occupancy. The practice of price-lowering for increased occupancy, therefore, does not serve the purpose and must be avoided.Optimize Distribution SystemsOptimizing distribution systems can be quite a challenge, but it is important. Asking the following questions will help you address the key concerns regarding optimization of distribution channel management and decide accordingly.Select the ideal combination of distribution systems to avoid frequent U-turns in distribution decisions that usually lead to wastage of time and resources.Build Long-Term Guest RelationshipsWhile the benefits of pricing your rooms higher than those of your competitors have been discussed, you must justify the same by giving your guests quality service. It is the single most important element that builds long-term customer relationships, which are much more critical for independent hotels than for large chains.Leverage Dynamic Pricing, but Cautiously!Although dynamic pricing may benefit a hotel due the opportunistic price-tweaking involved therein, it should not be overdone. Caution must be practiced with dynamic pricing operations in a highly competitive market. Demand forecasts should be made with a thorough study of aspects such as arrivals, reservations, conversions, cancellations, group bookings, no shows, seasonality and customer loyalty.Pricing intelligence software tools are much needed, to compare prices, track inventory, to give hotels the market information they need and to aid their pricing decisions and distribution. If a revenue manager makes a learned decision to use pricing as a competitive weapon, dynamic pricing can become one of the most effective tools in the combat for price-sensitive customers. Hence, keeping a steady and competitive price is beneficial.Focus on Non-Room RevenueWho said rooms are the only focal point for all revenue activity? Bars, pools, gaming halls and spas contribute much too. Hotels offering such elite services can strategically price them in accordance with customer segmentation and demand forecasts to drive in more revenue than otherwise.Leverage big data for to analyse guest habitsUse data collected through various platforms and different stages of a guest life cycle.for analysis of demand patterns, guest preferences, feed for changes in market price, occupancy, etc. This will save both time and resources – the two critical elements independent hotels always run short of.Boost Your Direct BookingsA December 2015 Phocuswright Study covering a large number of hotels in Europe and U.S. revealed that direct bookings from the hotel’s website would make for more than 26% of online sales, including mobile phone bookings. This will only increase now as hoteliers begin to understand the potential of an own website with an efficient online booking tool to substantially increase revenues.Is this enough?Not really.Independent hotels lack resources and time to invest in dedicated staff to manage several critical revenue management tasks, one of which is Marketing. An inability to shell out commissions for OTA listings limits their market reach. This, in turn, translates into a lack of sufficient reviews to help customers’ decision making on online hotel bookings. You clearly need something more. And, so we thought: How about automating some critical tasks to get the much-needed operational efficiency?A competent Channel Manager is necessary for efficient distribution of your inventory.How Marketing Automation Rescues you from the Typical Independent-Hotelier’s ChallengesIndependent hoteliers must make the switch to automation of certain marketing tasks, which would otherwise consume much time and resources to tap the enormous revenue-making benefits that technology brings along.Although obtaining a customized automation software is an investment, the long-term operational benefits coming from the same are unmatched.The same can also be followed in inter-departmental communication to keep various interlinked operations of your hotel running smoothly.Being an independent hotelier, however challenging in the competitive market, offers invaluable opportunities to stay ahead in the market. Bigger chains have strict rules and procedures, the absence of which offers room for creativity for independent hotels.Since many guests seek an authentic experience, independent hotels can carve out their niche in that segment as well. Couple it with an automated marketing operation and an effective revenue management strategy, and the benefits will delight you!",https://rategain.com/blog/revenue-management-marketing-automation-for-independent-hotels/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Action-Plan-Action-Plan-Str-159437243-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Action-Plan-Action-Plan-Str-159437243-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Revenue Management,,,,,,,0

Just creating a beautiful building, nicely decorated rooms and a well-trained staff force is not enough to delight your potential guests and ensure business keeps running.Many new and pre-opening hotels struggle to reach their optimum revenue potential because of lack of knowledge of in-depth pricing strategies to address unpredictable market demand and a poor understanding of hotel pre-opening groundwork.It is essentially important that hotels follow a planned and standardized approach to pre-opening phase to ensure consistent and effective results from day one.Implementation and integration of revenue management technologies with the hotel’s IT infrastructure and platforms are one of the important tasks at the pre-opening stage itself that management teams at many hotels miss.Developing market segment revenue & sales strategies, comprehensive competitor evaluation, pricing research, and forward forecasting of market demand patterns are a few of the very important aspects from the revenue management perspective.Let us classify the process as follows:It is advisable that all such planning and implementation of any technology solutions should be undertaken at least 6-12 months prior to the hotel’s soft opening. Hotel staff should ensure that all tools and operational systems are in place and that all pricing and other processes that they track like – key competitor performance data, daily competitor performance and pricing data, are all functioning accurately.Not only this, hoteliers should keep in mind that it is very vital to re-evaluate and assess the original assumptions and strategies developed during pre-opening, as pre-opening plans and post-opening realities are often different.Hotel management staff needs to be flexible in their methodology in the initial phase of the opening so that they can adjust their plans & strategies and respond promptly to consequences and progressing market conditions.Apart from these, there are few other important things to concentrate on before the launch, which will ensure revenue starts rolling in early-Following all these techniques will allow hotels to prepare their staff and get overall management buy-in for the hotel’s approach to overall revenue management strategy. This will help warrant that your revenue management solutions are working most effectively.",https://rategain.com/blog/hotel-revenue-management-strategy-pre-opening/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-133294829-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-133294829-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Revenue Management,Revenue maximization,,,,,,0
65632902a3f6fc78b8eba2da,-624874507,"Hoteliers, Keep a Track of Events and Holidays To Increase your Revenue Many Folds","February 20, 2017","For hoteliers, pricing can be a dizzying task, especially how the cost of the same room at the same time can vary dramatically from one date to the next. Especially for the dates that have some important events scheduled. Events and holidays are a high business period for hotels.However, there is definitely a technique to the seeming craziness.Travel is one of the most sought after ways to spend a holiday. Events and holidays present an immense opportunity for hoteliers to increase their hotel bookings and revenues. Thus, hotels should definitely keep a tab on the upcoming events in their city & locality and holiday season also for their city and their different source markets.In this article, we will be discussing the importance of tracking events and holidays for a hotelier and its impact on hotel bookings and revenue –Hotels implement their pricing based on many different factors including the market they are operating in; a very significant one of them is events and holidays that may affect their demand for rooms and the room types they have to sell. Prices for rooms may change significantly every single night basis these factors.The guest mix in a hotel may also affect whether room rates go up or down. For illustration, vacationers might be more price sensitive than business travellers.In fact, different hotel types also get impacted differently. A business hotel will get huge bookings if an important business event or a conference is planned in their city or locality and might get least impacted by a festival or social event coming up on a weekend or a holiday on an extended weekend.However, a leisure or family hotel will be impacted in a different manner, for example, they will witness more demand on weekends, extended weekends, holidays and any festival or on the dates of any local event being planned.This is also followed by room type being sold; families prefer king size rooms or twin beds, whereas business travellers book single occupancy rooms more.Therefore, both these hotels will not only have a different booking pattern during the week, but also a different booking pattern for different room types. Accordingly, their pricing strategy will vary for each date and room type.Irrespective of these variables, delivering great customer value is key for any hotel operator and fair pricing is a critical component in that equation. However, at the same time generating maximum profit is the core of any business.Big concerts, sports events or a major business conference, are all boon for the host city. Hotel bookings rise to as high as 200% or more depending on the importance of the event, increasing the room prices many folds.Keeping a track of important events for future dates, helps Revenue Managers plan their inventory stocks and prices for different time slabs from the actual event date/check-in date.This planning will certainly help them generate more revenue. For example, for annual fests/fixed events which are popular, travellers start booking them months in advance, thus it is a good time for hotels to make more revenue and it is smart of them if they keep a major percentage of their inventory open to booking say 4 months prior to check-in dates. Keep a small percentage of high priced room inventory just close to the event date.Same will apply for the big business events, preparation for which starts at least 6 months in advance. Otherwise, business hotels usually make maximum revenue on last minute bookings.It is not a bad idea if hotels also promote an event in their city and entice travellers with offers like free passes to the event in case your guest book 2-3 nights stay in your hotel.Revenue Managers don’t ignore the fact that events and holidays are not meant just for outstation travellers. Local guests also contribute significantly to your room bookings and other revenue mediums like spa, restaurants, etc. for people looking out for a relaxed stay-cation in their local city.Technology solutions are the best way to ensure that your hotel has the maximum visibility during the high-traffic holiday season. By listing your property on as many OTAs as possible, you can increase the number of ‘eyeballs’ seeing your hotel – and thus the online bookings.It is not possible to manage a large number of online distribution channels manually – and that is where technology comes in handy in the form of a cutting edge online distribution manager and rate shopping tools.There are Rate shopping tools for the perusal of hoteliers that allows them to add all the important events in their calendar or rate-shopping card. Not only this, such systems also allow you to mark the importance and impact (Popularity Index number) of these events on your hotel bookings. This greatly helps hotels design their pricing strategy for these specific dates.Keeping a close track on events saves RMs from losing that extra revenue that they can earn on the table, but not at the cost of low occupancy.",https://rategain.com/blog/track-events-and-holidays-increase-hotel-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Calendar-Note-Schedule-Memo-Ma-148425554-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Calendar-Note-Schedule-Memo-Ma-148425554-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,Revenue Management,,,,,0
65632907a3f6fc78b8eba2dc,1571220017,3 Effective Hotel Pricing Strategy Can Boost Your Hotel Revenue,"February 13, 2017","The hotel industry appears to be quite glamorous and exciting to all of us. Top class hospitality, well-equipped rooms, fancy facilities, etc. – all this is done with an aim to create a seamlessly pleasant experience for guests. Needless to say, all this comes at a price which the guest actually has to pay.However, at the back end of the hotel, things are a little more complex and tricky. The revenue leaders are often grappling with a lot of insights and information to come up with best practices for the benefit of the guest. A host of technology-driven hotel revenue management systems and processes are required to be put in place, and some good people and procedures need to be employed to ensure that the customer gets the best share of offerings, price being the most important component.The practice of hotel revenue management has assumed a significant role in the recent years, with the techniques of revenue management being increasingly adopted by all kinds of hotels, big or small, helping them to stand out in the clutter and steer their way forward.Essentially, it is a practice wherein hotels, by the use of different tools and actions, try to achieve an optimal level of net revenues.Pricing is certainly critical to the success of all hotels and a well-designed hotel pricing strategy can do wonders by giving a strong push to the hotel revenues. What is important is how you derive at the appropriate pricing and what kind of strategy you choose. Hence, revenue management is the new way of doing business in the hospitality industry.Appropriate pricing strategy is a key ingredient and an important step towards hotel revenue maximization. A good price can be an indication towards healthy profit margins, which confirms growth. To a consumer, a price might seem to be just a plain number quoted by the hotel, which they might choose to vary from guest to guest or from time to time. But the reality is different.Hotel Pricing Strategy #1- Demand-Supply BalanceThe revenue leaders delve deep down into their pricing strategy to derive a perfect sense of this important aspect. One of the most important factors which is to be taken into consideration while setting the prices is the demand-supply balance i.e. demand is to be matched with the available inventory, and then an optimal price is derived by making use of data analytics.If the demand shoots up, a high pricing appears as the best solution, and vice-versa. The economics of demand and supply also suggests that lower prices lead to more bookings, but at the expense of generating high revenue. On the other hand, higher prices could lead to more rooms staying unoccupied. Price is clearly, one of the most effective variables that can be manipulated to encourage or discourage demand in the short run.Hotel Pricing Strategy #2- Pricing Quoted by the CompetitionAnother key factor to be taken into account in the highly competitive market scenario is the pricing quoted by the competition. The price offered to the consumer by any hotel is most often compared – with other hotels or with different aggregation channels which are known to offer the best rates in the industry most of the times.Yes, it is important to make sure that there isn’t a high fluctuation in the price range across different channels in the industry. If the competition is offering lower prices than you, it might mean a loss of a significant chunk of your business. Thus, it is important to be updated with the industry trends and act in line with them.Hotel Pricing Strategy #3- Hotel ImagesThe pricing strategy must be in line with the hotel image. Setting your prices without a thorough grasp of your overall objectives can destroy any brand-building efforts. A three-star hotel offering the rates of a five-star property is likely to confuse the customers who might choose to move away, causing a permanent damage, possibly beyond repair.The emergence of multiple channels of online booking has led to a greater transparency in the price offerings, helping the consumers in decision-making. Any deviation in prices from the ongoing market trend catches the attention of the travellers very soon.It is a common behaviour of all consumers to raise eyebrows on any quoted price and to compare the same on different channels with an aim to steal the best offer. The online medium has made this simple.Well, pricing is certainly critical to the success of all hotels and a well-designed pricing strategy can do wonders by giving a strong push to the hotel revenues. What is important is how you derive at the appropriate pricing and what kind of strategy you choose.Whether you use a well-refined price-optimisation system or determine your rates manually, it is utmost essential to assess all the information carefully and thoroughly to validate your pricing decisions.Dear subscribers, we will be talking about different pricing techniques in our next series of blogs.Related Article : A Complete Guide to Hotel Marketing Strategy for 2023",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-hotel-pricing-strategy-to-boost-revenue/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Pricing-Strategy-141013019-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Pricing-Strategy-141013019-2800x1400-scaled.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Blog,,,price optimization,pricing strategy,,,,,,0

With changing times, where new ideas and technologies are being introduced every now and then to enhance their overall experience, consumer satisfaction has assumed utmost importance. A happy consumer defines the success of any business and an unsatisfied one calls for the businesses to have a re-look at their processes. The hospitality industry is all about serving people right and delivering the best-in-class experience to their patrons. What the guest feels and says is very important, and responding to their concerns is a critical aspect to the growth of hotel business.We bow our heads to this splendid thing called technology, opening a host of avenues for the traveller to vent out their opinions on their stay experience with any hotel. Gone are those days when an unsatisfied guest could probably do no or little harm if he disliked any part of his stay at the property. At most, he would not return to the hotel, or perhaps spread a negative word of mouth, the impact of which is mostly limited. But, the rise of social media has put that chapter of no impact of providing bad experience to an end. In fact, it has toughened the job of hoteliers, who are now on their toes, constantly to ensure that the guest leaves with a smile on his face and will give a good review about their hotel. Apart from this a happy consumer helps them earn an extra point and a pat on their backs.As social media gradually rose to make deeper inroads in our lives, online reviews became one of the most important factors affecting the traveller’s decision to book a hotel. According to a study made by TripAdvisor and PhoCusWright, 77% of travellers refer to online reviews before choosing a hotel. A number of hotel review websites have come into existence recently, encouraging guests to rate their experience of staying in a hotel. A good review is a bonus point, which goes a long way in establishing a pleasant image and a high ranking of the hotel on review sites. At the same time, a negative review has the potential to harm the hotel reputation, thereby impacting its business.Till the time you are receiving positive remarks it is all easy and good, but what when you get a negative mention about our hotel. Further, not responding to online reviews or inappropriate response could probably cause an irreparable damage to the well-being of the hotel.Below are some smart tips to manage them, that every hotel must follow – It is rightly said that the building of a brand image might take several years, but only a few seconds to thrash it into pieces. Technology, especially social media, has made the statement come true for the hospitality industry as well. A few negative reviews have the power to destroy the hotel image and business, and by not responding to these reviews, the game could be simply over. When and how you respond to these serious reviews can do wonders, and even win your customers back.The game could be yours, again!",https://rategain.com/blog/how-to-manage-hotel-online-reviews/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotel-reviews-760x380.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotel-reviews-760x380.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632910a3f6fc78b8eba2e0,-712386795,Why Should Hotels Pay Special Attention to Demand Forecasting?,"January 25, 2017","For a revenue manager, a hotel demand forecasting solution is a holy tool.Revenue managers spend a considerable time in coming up with a forecasting analysis. And thus it is obvious for them to be a little touchy about it. But it is also important that Revenue Managers understand when a forecast needs to be altered and also the reason it needs a modification.The reasons could be many like the Revenue Manager might have missed any important market dynamics while coming up with their demand forecasting analysis.Let’s discuss this closely in this blog, and understand why demand forecasting is important and also why it is important to do it the right way.Table of ContentsThree reasons why we need to do Demand Forecasting: For setting the correct strategies for driving incremental profitsIt is important for an efficient and proactive Revenue Manager to regularly do a detailed analysis and forecast per category/type of inventory, so as to get an accurate insight into the market dynamics and demand & supply.Important factors to look at are demand curves, market share details, distribution stats, conversion and cancellation ratios, competition pricing trends, seasonal impacts, and events etc.Technology has come in really handy for revenue managers; handling vast amounts of data with revenue management systems is much more convenient and faster. Additionally, it is much easier now to manage multiple properties simultaneously with revenue management solutions available.Consolidating information at the micro and macro level.The best part about having a well-formulated hotel demand forecast analysis is that it shows exactly how your inventory is being consumed and offers revenue managers the opportunity to refine their inventory distribution strategy like controlling different segments, monitoring (increase/decrease) your BAR rate, setting a minimum length of stay in times of surplus demand, are the ways which bring real value of the incremental revenue to your hotel.Let us understand this with an example of a big hotel or a group of hotels; demand and occupancy predictions at a micro level are important for sales team and management to know. Like sales head or GM will be rightly able to put their efforts in the correct direction if they have such information handy well in time. Such demand forecasting will help the sales team to manage their sales and marketing budgets and strategies to be designed and used effectively. So this is a micro level planning for running operations profitably.At a macro level for a big hotel, demand forecasting is filtered on various parameters like region/country wise, city level or each property wise, etc.  Such consolidated and filtered data helps head office or management guys to take a decision at a strategic level about the time, money and efforts to be allocated as per the requirement and forecasting reports.Further, these stats will serve as a base for the management to communicate about the company’s financial status, which will have an impact on stock prices also. And this is the reason why accurate forecasting figures become important at a macro level. It is the fine balance that needs to be maintained in coming out with any strategy basis this prediction data. This is because an overstated forecast will upset the financial market and can lead to undesirable drops in share value, on the other a too strict projection can upset the stakeholders and investors and will put unnecessary stress on the management.Utilizing demand forecasting data collaboratively at other departmentsOne very important point that is usually missed out is that such hotel demand forecast data are utilized by hotels for only commercial and sales related needs only. Whereas findings from the forecast can be used for the benefit of the entire hotel. How?Precisely calculated occupancy data can help in various functions like – estimating F&B expenditures, housekeeping expenditures and cost per room. This will help in predicting F&B revenues and overall operating costs for the next few months or quarter. And furthermore purchasing and staffing departments and plan their work. If executed nicely, this is part of total revenue management.Treat Group and Transient business separatelyAn important factor that is missed at times is the difference between transient and group business forecasting. Group bookings are more unpredictable and thus more inaccurate. One point to be kept in mind is that you should have a thorough analysis of the reason for deviation so that accuracy is more the next time.Also, you will be surprised to know that many times these are valid reasons and at the same time they are unpredictable also; like you may receive a huge group booking done or cancelled last moment. Such situations are highly unpredictable.However, if such instances help you overachieve, you will obviously pay less attention to accuracy. But under-performance will definitely be an issue. Thus, by keeping accuracy as your main focus, you can fully depend on it as a basis for setting up your hotel strategies for the future. Thus, it is advisable to go for tools which give you results as close to 100% accurate result.Conclusion: We all will agree without a doubt that accuracy in hotel demand forecasting is very important for our planning to be bang on!! But what is debatable is what is more important; achieving or accuracy.Well, any given day, overachieving is also equally desirable, but not at the cost of under accuracy.",https://rategain.com/blog/why-should-hotels-pay-special-attention-to-demand-forecasting/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotelier-demand-forecasting-762x381.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotelier-demand-forecasting-762x381.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Demand forecasting,,,,,,,0

6563291aa3f6fc78b8eba2e4,1760136335,Managing Real-Time Room Inventories Across Multiple OTAs,"December 27, 2016","We know that hotels choose to manage their OTAs or Online Travel Agents through an extranet, which might be linked to a preferred channel management software. A quota of the entire inventory is allotted through this interface, so the hotel’s rooms can be put up on the OTA (during off season and season periods) for proper distribution.When occupancy is high, the hotel blocks all its rooms for itself. Contrastingly, during off season, they keep the option open and a huge percentage of the inventory gets allotted to the OTAs. As a result, OTAs keep increasing their market share in the online distribution landscape.“The fact is that these days, listing on an OTA takes hardly a week’s time. Also, hotels are smart. They sign up with OTAs well in advance and go live for selling, way before the hotel opens. The main challenge is updating the details of a hotel on the extranet”, says Sumit Gupta, Group Revenue Manager – India & Africa at Sarovar Hotels & Resorts.In 2015, hotels across the globe followed a trend wherein they tried to decrease their participation on too many OTAs and instead focused on a few big players. This trend will continue through 2017 and beyond.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""alignnone wp-image-6320 size-medium"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pie1-300x226.jpg"" alt=""pie1"" width=""300"" height=""226"" /><img decoding=""async"" class=""alignright wp-image-6321 size-medium"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pie-2-300x226.jpg"" alt=""pie-2"" width=""300"" height=""226"" />However, some renowned players have started rolling out aggressive strategies in the field of commission negotiations. So, the whole idea of managing OTA channels and saving on commission percentages has given rise to numerous new job titles and technologies.The Hotel Distribution Manager establishes the foundation of this technological wave, for it is an extension of the traditional revenue manager and channel management or rate management tools.Hospitality industry pundits claim that hotels typically use a cocktail of software solutions to manage their inventory as well as correctly update details on the extranet. According to Phocuswright, in the European Independent Lodging Landscape alone, the following stats hold true.50% of independent properties have an Internet Booking engine.31% have a property management system.30% of hotels have a central reservation system39% have a channel manager.Let’s delve a little deep into the details of the three most popular software solutions which are used to manage real-time room inventories across OTAs and the hotel’s extranet.Property management System:It is better known and abbreviated as a ‘PMS’ and is the main software solution that can help to run a hotel. Branches of a PMS deal with room inventory, check-ins, check-outs, F&B outlets, billing etc.Big chain hotels these days use integrated software tools that have the entire inventory built within the PMS. They handle both online and offline bookings and here, the inventory is always live.Hotels do not keep their rooms available for OTAs as they want maximum revenue and also want to sell rooms through profitable channels.Channel Managers:Hotels today are resorting to a channel management solution for the distribution of room rates and availability on OTAs, exclusively for revenue maximization. For the records, distribution technology is challenging as it caters to hotels of all sizes, OTAs, booking engines, wholesalers, tour operators etc.A distribution system can ideally do the following:OTA Extranet: It is an OTAs easy-to-use booking management system.Why should you log-in to one?With these systems in place, hotels are able to integrate critical operations, from a single platform. The staff stays up-to-date and real-time information is accessible in a click, thereby allowing hoteliers to exercise complete control over their property(s).",https://rategain.com/blog/managing-real-time-room-inventories-across-multiple-otas/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/otas-versus-branddotcom-1740x870.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/otas-versus-branddotcom-1740x870.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pie1-300x226.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pie-2-300x226.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Distribution,,,,,,,0

65632920a3f6fc78b8eba2e8,-1065212521,Be the Revenue Management Hero of your Hotel,"November 28, 2016","Expectations from the people working in the hospitality industry are always high and is growing even stronger every year. This need is very much driven by smart and over-demanding customer type this industry caters to.The shelf life of any trend, service or technology in the hospitality industry is very short. Before you could even realize, a competitive offering that was considered as leading-edge, suddenly becomes just another standard guest expectation. Not every long back, free Wi-Fi, complimentary breakfast and happy hours were considered competitive selling points for hotels, but now it is no longer an inviting offering for guests to consider your property for booking, in fact it has become a very routine proposition.Similarly, from hotelier’s point of view, tools and technology that were used till very soon, are no longer a competitive advantage to even sustain in the market, forget being in the lead.When technology tools were first introduced used in the hospitality industry, the whole industry went gaga over it over a period of time. And soon the whole fraternity was using it, as they fear lagging behind in the competition.And, now when all your competitors are using hospitality technology solutions, how do you ensure that you still stand out.Just ensuring that you provide best of the service and competitive rates, will not give you that lead in the market that you are looking for. So what is that you need to do, to stand out from the crowd of hotels in our vicinity.Innovation is the name of the game. Innovative revenue managers are always looking out for innovative techniques of increasing their revenue share. But, what is it that you really need to do to stand out from the pack.But as they say – “Real heroes don’t do different things; they do things differently”.“Edison’s electric light did not come about from the continuous improvement of the candles”So progressive hoteliers, you need a disruptive technology that can transform your Revenue Management process and brand you as a HERO at your hotel.So, let’s pull the cat out of the bag; first movers, smart revenue managers are opting for unified systems and no more multiple independent tools, which are not in sync with each other.Still wondering how will this make you a Hero; lets dive a little deeper.Let’s look at how a typical day in the life of a revenue manager looks like; RMs job require them to make fast on the job judgements and decisions. For which it is very fundamental that the data and the informational insights are available to them at just a few clicks.Integration between various systems (CRS, PMS, GDS, ORM, IBE, etc.) and data accuracy is absolutely indispensable to get the best out of these systems; all the more because a revenue manager’s, decisions are based on data acquired from different systems.Revenue managers are capable of strategic planning and decision-making; human influences are impossible for any software to replicate and that silhouette the implementation of revenue management strategy. What is needed is just a good system to assist a revenue manager in this process.But the whole purpose goes for a toss, if managing these systems itself becomes a critical task for a revenue manager.Imagine how convenient it would be if we have a single system that can do it all. And it will save you from so many troubles too.Benefits that integrated or unified systems bring in are numerous; a few are listed below:\n\nCohesive solutions help revenue managers achieve their primary KPIs and much more than that. Such systems can be very well termed as a magic wand for the revenue managers, as it will help them with so many wishes of them to come true like – accurate forecasting, single image inventory, and rates, RevPAR leadership, increase in ADR and achieving maximum revenue.The recipe to become a Hero is right here – A seamless connection between all relevant tools such as Rate Shopper, Price Optimization, Channel Manager, OTAs, PMS, CRS, GDS and Social media platforms.So a unified system is what revenue managers need to bring in more efficiency in their daily operations. An integrated system that talks with all the other systems, so that you don’t have to spend hours gathering data from one system, processing on another and publishing through the third system.And who will not feel like a Hero, if they can do it all so smoothly.",https://rategain.com/blog/be-the-revenue-management-hero-of-your-hotel/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rev_hero_img-472x236.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rev_hero_img-472x236.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,price optimization,Revenue Management,,,,,,0

Irrespective of the fact whether your restaurant is present in one or multiple locations, its growth is highly dependent on a hale and hearty brand strategy.So how do we start?Believe it or not, the competition among restaurants has become more aggressive than ever before. Staying in this business would require you to put out a few fires every now and then.Clearly, several areas of restaurant operations are not data-centric any longer. Nevertheless, a revenue manager’s inputs are always indispensable, since many of these areas are direct guest touchpoints. Yet, hotels hesitate to introduce new technologies and ways to contact with guests. The ability to connect with them via a mobile phone, especially considering daily use of smartphones should not be underestimated. That’s where you should begin.A Trip Barometer report from TripAdvisor, captured from data via a survey of thousands of hotels around the world, found that ensuring how a property’s online presence is managed is likely to receive the most injection of financial support this year, with online reviews considered the most important area of a business.According to Tnooz, coming behind online reputation management in the five biggest increases in investment by hotels, is likely to be:“Our second major project of 2016 is Facebook for Customer Service. Facebook has recently upgraded its Pages, providing a business with the ability to engage customers on its platform. More than 50 million businesses use Facebook; most of which should leverage the platform for customer service and support.” – This was published in a Gartner report only recently.Industry pundits say that brand loyalists for your restaurant are driven by emotion and function. When you are looking at reputation management for your restaurant, there are three ways to do it in order to leverage emotion and function:How can your restaurant establish it’s online reputation and build brand loyalty?It is always best to start the process online. The Internet is where all the reviews and ratings are posted and you can bank on it.Below enlisted are five simple ways to build your restaurant’s online reputation:Remember, by using an automated restaurant online reputation management solution, you can achieve all this and much more in very little time. On the other hand, automating time-consuming, as well as vital processes in your restaurants, will give you ample time to pay attention to little details as well as tweak your strategy to achieve customer loyalty, and ultimately success in the long run.",https://rategain.com/blog/tips-to-build-customer-loyalty-for-your-restaurant/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/restaurant-948x474.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/restaurant-948x474.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632925a3f6fc78b8eba2ec,1058222358,"Systems Reliability, A Necessity for Hotel Operations: Part 2","November 18, 2016","In the introduction post to Systems Reliability blog series, we discussed a high-level overview of the different types of systems and common challenges that we often hear from our potential customers. In this blog series, we will discuss one of the most frequently discussed issues which is a lack of integrations and interfaces.According to a study conducted by Phocuswright for European and North American properties, Technology use among independent lodging properties is at a basic level. While many use Internet booking engines, only a small number have implemented more sophisticated technologies such as channel managers or (even fewer) a customer relationship management (CRM) system that might help control their marketing and distribution more effectively.Obviously, the first step in achieving a well-integrated system is to invest in a reliable channel manager. This is a very valuable investment that will show strong ROI, save you a lot of time, and allow you to market your hotel on a huge variety of channels. It´s also a great way to more evenly spread your distribution. When shopping for a channel manager, here are some important questions to ask, in regard to reliability, integrations and interfaces.Ask for a list of the provider’s current available distribution channels. A well-connected channel manager should have hundreds of channels available and new connection requests can be made. Available channels should also include the following:Ideally, with the above-mentioned connections in place, you will only have to make rate and availability updates in 1 central system.Another good question to ask is the type of connection available for each of your important channels. What type of updates you can make, concerning the following factors:It is important to understand this, as the distribution partner might lack suitable technology in their extranets, thereby making some updates impossible.To take a step further, is your channel manager connected to your PMS, CRS and RMS, and if so, how does this functionality work? What type of integration is possible including rates, availability, restrictions and reservation delivery?The following chart below shows the ideal technology connectivity and integration flow for distribution.<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-3230 size-thumbnail"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/event-thumbnil-150x150.jpg"" alt=""presentation1-003"" width=""150"" height=""150"" />The structure in the above chart is what your hotel should strive for in terms of distribution integration. It is obviously an investment for the hotel but well worth it, allowing you to save precious time by cutting down on manual and repetitive tasks. More time can be spent on decision making and fast reactive decisions that can be pushed out to the market within seconds. The key to driving more market share is quick reaction and speed to market which this integrated environment allows.<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-3210 size-medium"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RezGain_Blog_Banner-e1479193186541.png"" alt=""rezgain_blog_banner"" width=""300"" height=""57"" /> <img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2753 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg"" alt=""effective-ways-to-measure-demand"" width=""1016"" height=""408"" /> ",https://rategain.com/blog/systems-reliability-a-necessity-for-hotel-operations-part-2/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Summer-Vacation-And-Online-Boo-98043824-1-300x141-282x141.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Summer-Vacation-And-Online-Boo-98043824-1-300x141-282x141.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/event-thumbnil-150x150.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RezGain_Blog_Banner-e1479193186541.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,,,,,,0
65632928a3f6fc78b8eba2ee,870731841,Is Your Hotel United by Goals but Divided by Systems?,"November 16, 2016","Almost all businesses have undergone a technology-driven revolution, and the hospitality industry is no different. Technology vendors have brainstormed adequate to offer a number of tools that have already transformed the way business is done in travel and hospitality industry, or the way that it will be done in the near future. The most common benefit that all these tools offer is the that they allow businesses to have a more convenient, cognizant and cherished relationship with their customers and much more ease of doing business.Revenue Managers are not untouched from this technology bombardment. For modern revenue managers, data means everything, but they are no longer spending their time churning data and spending moron no. of hours trying to derive an insight and decision from it. They are smart and are thus increasingly using technology for managing their end to end operations of a hotel and revenue management.Hotels of all kinds independent, chain hotels, franchised; all use technology for their daily tasks; and the good part is technology vendors have something to offer to each one of them, no matter you are a small independent hotel or a big chain.Revenue managers need to make fast on job decisions. Therefore, it is very crucial that the data and the informational insights flow very fast across all the systems.On an average day, for a revenue manager, decisions are based on data acquired from different systems (CRS, PMS, GDS, etc.); but integration between these systems and data accuracy is absolutely essential to get the best out of them.Hotels today are using multiple systems from different vendors on a daily basis for various hotel and revenue management activities like – rate shopping, price optimization, online channel distribution and of course online reputation management. Not having the real time updated data and working with systems that don’t sync with each other can cost revenue to hotels, leading to headaches for every department in the organization.Technology solution providers have very well come to the rescue of hoteliers here; latest addition here is unified revenue management systems. Seamless integrated cloud-based systems are a trend and definitely the need of the hour too for hoteliers.In fact, currently unified systems are as revolutionary an idea as using technology was some two-decade back. And those who will not flow with this new trend will certainly be left behind vis-a- vis those who will adopt it.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3223"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sdfas.png"" alt=""integrated-systems-1"" width=""430"" height=""251"" />Why an Integrated and Unified system is needed – It is difficult for a revenue manager to keep a continuous tab on data coming from different systems to sew them into a valuable insight.Benefits of using a single unified SaaS platform:Coordination with one single vendor – no more headaches of managing multiple vendors, tracking multiple billing, etc. Thus you have only one throat to choke in case of any disruptions.Unified solutions help you achieve the KPIs and even more than what you wanted to achieve with your multiple systems working in silos. Such solution helps you achieve maximum revenue, accurate forecasting, single image inventory, and rates, RevPAR leadership and increase in ADR.So, it will not be incorrect to state if we say that the hospitality industry is going way ahead of just using technology for their revenue management needs; instead, the world is moving beyond systems. Today the trend is about one stop solution for all your needs.Change or stay behind.<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3224"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RezGain_Blog_Banner.jpg"" alt=""Unity_CaseStudy_banner"" width=""398"" height=""75"" data-wp-editing=""1"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/is-your-hotel-united-by-goals-but-divided-by-systems/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sdf-740x370.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sdf-740x370.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sdfas.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RezGain_Blog_Banner.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,price optimization,Revenue Management,,,,,,0

Visitors also get to choose from several offers and customized packages catering to all age groups.As another addition to the Brilliant Hotelier series, our ambitious and self-driven Account Manager, Mr. Ankur Yadav recently had a word with Mr. I Nyoman Astama, the esteemed General Manager of the Bali Niksoma Boutique Beach Resort. During the interaction, Astama candidly spoke about the hotel’s amenities and how the resort embraced technology-driven practices to craft a leading yet exemplary Indonesian retreat.Ankur: Thanks for joining us Mr. Nyoman. Congratulations on winning the Indonesia Leading Boutique Hotel 2015/2016 by ITTA and for also making it into the TripAdvisor “HALL OF FAME 2015”. What do you think are the unique and special features of Bali Niksoma Boutique Beach Resort?Astama: My pleasure Ankur and thanks for your kind words! The accolades were not a surprise I must admit (laughs). Honestly, we try to maintain a consistent service quality with a steady conformance to guest expectations.At Bali Niksoma, we have 5 types of rooms namely the Superior, Deluxe, Junior Suite, Suite and Presidential Villa. These 58 rooms are designed and built indigenously, retaining the true essence of Bali’s soul. Guests spending their time in these rooms can actually enjoy a tranquil ambience in the midst of plush interiors and spacious living areas. Other special features for the guests include Hatha Yoga sessions, afternoon tea arrangements, sensational seafood BBQ dinners and Balinese cultural dance performances, to name a few.Ankur: You are ranked as one of the Top Boutique hotels in the Legian region on TripAdvisor. The Acoustic Dinner feature for instance, is remarkable and actually make you stand out. How did you come up with this innovative idea?Astama: We want every leisurely evening spent at the resort to be special for our guests, and we leave no stone unturned to ensure the same. By the same token, our guests can now enjoy soft and smoky undertones of acoustic music. Lingering notes of rich and earthy tunes make them happily indulge into the sumptuous a la carte cuisine from our Chef’s kitchen. This dinner is arranged on every Wednesday evening and we are happy that our guests enjoy the ambience in this setup. Due to popular demand, we are planning to make the relaxed Acoustic Dinner a regular practice in the near future.Ankur: That’s remarkable! Your resort amalgamates natural setups with the latest technology. For instance, your website displays local temperature and time. This is an interesting feature for a website visitor. Tell us how you plan to balance the usage of technology with your day-to-day business?Astama: The hospitality industry in Bali incorporates eco-friendly practices to stay as close to the nature as possible. However, the complicated business also needs technology adaptation for greater efficiency, such as automation of systems, water recycling, solar energy, free Wi-Fi etc.Ankur: Since connectivity is quintessential today, what’s your take on RateGain? Have we helped you in your journey?Astama: RateGain has been a true partner and the team aligned to our property has paved the way for a plethora of new distribution avenues. Channel Manger tool – RezGain helps us to seamlessly distribute rates, restrictions, and inventory online. There is no manual day-to-day management as a result of which, we can now focus better on building a richer guest experience.I would also like to mention Optima – the smart hotel rate shopper from RateGain. With the help of powerful dashboard analytics in the tool, we are now able to analyze our comp-set better as well as leverage the power of price intelligence. Hence, we are now able to identify source markets better which has resulted in a stark improvement in our RevPAR and ADR numbers over the past few months.Ankur: A big “Thank You” to you and your team at the Bali Niksoma Boutique Beach Resort. We once again congratulate you on your commitment to eco-friendliness and guest centricity.Astama: Thank you Ankur.

65632932a3f6fc78b8eba2f4,1278352902,Is your Hotel Website Ready for Google's Latest Mobile Updates,"November 8, 2016","Revenue managers did you analyze if your customers are really happy? If yes, then your business is surely on the way to growth. Good news!The pride and success of any business lie in the kind of experience it is able to deliver to its customers. Interestingly, with fast evolving technology, the traveler community has also evolved quite rapidly, in terms of their behavior, choices, and demands, etc.The current era is marked by the striking phenomenal growth of mobile technology, we shared about this in our last blog also – Optimize Your Hotel’s SEO and Mobile Strategy. In this blog, we will talk about points to consider when going for the mobile friendly website.The tremendous use of mobile internet having shaken the functioning of each industry immensely. Mobile phones have become an indispensable necessity of human lives now, it is no longer just a lifestyle statement, as it was a few years ago. Businesses across varied industries are stupendously capitalizing on this sharp trend by defining a unique mobile strategy and incorporating the same in their overall growth trajectory. The hotel industry is, by no means, an exception.Keeping in mind the radically changing consumer behavior, the search engines have also fused to this trend of growth of mobile internet. Google has laid down a host of mobile updates in the recent few months, strongly favoring mobile-friendly websites now, by giving them a higher ranking in the search engine results. The websites of companies are now weighed on different parameters which make mobile usability a direct ranking factor in its Search Algorithm.Yes, it is definitely time for the businesses to construct or revisit their mobile websites, in order to maintain their online visibility intact. If your website is not mobile-friendly, you are probably on your way out, as you might be pushed down on the search page results and also leave your customers unhappy. Quite perilous, it can be!These changes have significant implications for the hotel industry. Mobile is undoubtedly driving the current hotel bookings scenario, with nearly 60% of searches taking place on smartphones, a 27% increase year-over-year (Google).  By 2018, mobile is expected to account for 35 percent of online bookings (World Travel Market). The revelations make it clear that having a mobile-friendly website has become utmost crucial and a strong, must-have for the success of any hotel’s business. Also the more since now customers are present on mobile internet for most of their needs, even booking their travel and also relying a lot on the online reviews of the other travelers, for their travel booking decisions it had become absolutely imperative for hotels to invest in mobile website along with a comprehensive online reputation management system.The hotel industry players are left with no choice at all, but to optimize their websites for mobile, and make consistent efforts to keep improving it from time to time. With myriad options of hotels available to travelers for booking their stay through mobile, Google being the prime facilitator redirecting the travelers to the hotel websites, it is certain that no hotel would like their site’s search results to dip.Surely, it is time to emphasize on the following:The above-listed points would go a long way in ensuring an improved engagement of users with the hotel’s mobile site, ultimately giving a boost to their mobile rankings and conversions. Hotels whose websites are already mobile optimized can sit back and relax – it is certainly not a sign of alarm for them. For those who haven’t really paid attention to this critical aspect, the time is definitely now. Perhaps, it is a make-or-break situation and a mobile-friendly website is certainly the need of the hour.",https://rategain.com/blog/is-your-hotel-website-ready-for-googles-latest-mobile-updates/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Google-update-mobile-friendly-850x425.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Google-update-mobile-friendly-850x425.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632935a3f6fc78b8eba2f6,1342104041,Optimize Your Hotel’s SEO and Mobile Strategy,"November 3, 2016","Before you go ahead, take a moment and recall anyone you know or work with you who doesn’t own a smartphone.What is the answer? I am sure you will agree that almost everyone owns and uses a smartpne these days both for personal and official purposes?It’s a data backed fact. The number of mobile users worldwide is forecasted to reach a whopping 2659.4 million by 2019!Now, that says a lot about mobile usage in today’s times. And, along with it comes an increased dependency on the gadget for surfing the internet, social networking and making online mobile transactions.Surprisingly, a large part of the latter comprises travel-related bookings. As much as 42% of travelers worldwide use mobile devices to book/plan trip, confirms a 2015 TripAdvisor study. And, the numbers increase as we quote these statistics.For hotels, it actually means they have to reconsider not only their online presence but also the mediums they can be reached.Let’s see how-1. Make Your Hotel Website Mobile-Friendly\n\nThe statistics we just shared above signal how hotels and travel businesses need to ensure that they deliver a smooth online experience to prospective clients. The most important one being, to ensure an SEO and Mobile friendly website. And here’s why:2. Do You Need a Dedicated Mobile Site? Hotels may choose whether to invest in a separate mobile website or adopt a responsive website, i.e. designing their website in a way that makes it accessible across a wide array of platforms with different operating systems, screen sizes, and resolutions.For the uninitiated, here is some rationale to go by.While a separate mobile website may help you capture your mobile audience well, owing to its fast loading speed, simple layout and ease of use, it may double the cost and effort involved in its maintenance. The effort doesn’t simply stop at the designing phase, but goes on with every new update to the desktop website that the mobile version needs to sync with.Responsive hotel website, on the other hand, will adjust everything from its resolution to features across different devices, snowballing its scope of accessibility. It may also be more SEO-friendly, as it will inherit the page rank of its desktop parent and eliminate the need to make different HTML5 scripts — a requirement for mobile-dedicated websites that will restart the process of achieving a good page rank from scratch!Although it demands low maintenance; a website with a responsive design requires gigantic initial investment as every nook and corner of the website needs optimization across all possible platforms.The upshot is, there is no right or wrong. The choice must be premised on suitability. With consideration to the available resources, if a hotel deems some information on the website unimportant for the user and prioritizes simplification, a mobile website seems suitable. By the same token, a responsive website may be a good choice for hoteliers willing to invest much in a long-term solution.3. UX vs. UIA balance of seamless User Experience (UX) coupled with a pleasant User Interface (UI) seems a general recipe for an excellent hotel website. However, given the emphasis on loading speed on mobile devices and less support for desktop-friendly extensions like flash and JavaScript, UI relegates to the back burner and UX takes priority. Investing in something that looks good but doesn’t work well is futile, after all.4. Improving Mobile-User Experience5. Now, Google Has a Mobile-Friendly Ranking System!In early 2015, Google started an algorithm that ranks mobile-friendly websites higher than other ones in mobile search results. This can dramatically impact a hotel’s overall SEO status. It is, hence, imperative for hotels to make their presence felt on mobile devices just as much as they would on desktops.When you click on the hotel listing on Google, it shows you lots of information along with the reviews. Apart from the reviews that come from Google, there is also an additional section that shows you reviews from third-party websites including Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda and more. A hotel’s website is a virtual face of hotel’s brand reputation. We have talked about it in the past also, that’s how important is your online reputation management.Again, we will emphasize on this fact, by quoting that hotels are increasing using tools and technology to manage their online rating and reviews. Apart from standalone products for the hospitality industry, there are also unified, integrated solutions available to take care of complete end to end needs of the Hospitality industry. More and more hoteliers are opting for such holistic solutions to make their daily operations faster and effective.Take this mobile-friendly test by Google now. It’s time to go mobile!",https://rategain.com/blog/optimize-your-hotels-seo-and-mobile-strategy/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-130275857-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-130275857-900x450.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632938a3f6fc78b8eba2f8,1450237222,"The Brilliant Hotelier: Face 2 Face with Stavros Drakou, Director at Cyprotels Hotels and Resorts, Cyprus","November 2, 2016","Welcome to Cyprotels Hotels & Resorts, the most serene hideout on the coast of the deep blue Mediterranean Sea. Imaginative architecture and homely setups here, have been highly praised by tourists on popular metasearch sites like TripAdvisor. Besides, the sea-facing rooms are tranquil and allow you to rewind, while watching the waves change colors amidst warm Cypriot hospitality and exquisite continental cuisine in abundance!All the properties under the banner are centrally located for tourists, with bars, shops, beaches and food joints situated only a stone’s throw away. The Cyprotel Faliraki, for instance, is a beautiful and well preserved double-storied hotel located on the beautiful eastern coast of Rhodes Island. On the other hand, the Cyprotel Florida in Ayia Napa caters to business and leisure guests alike. These properties feature a wide range of facilities, like recreational facilities, pools, billiards corners and lots more, to make your stay, a pleasant experience. Moreover, with so much happening around the island, there is always an event to keep you fascinated!Recently, Kunwardeep Singh (KD), our assiduous Account Manager conversed with Stavros Drakou, the Director of Cyprotels Hotels and Resorts. Some extracts from their hour-long conversation have been illustrated in this blog post.KD: Thanks for taking time out for our Brilliant Hotelier series and congratulations for a great overall performance in Cyprus. You have received several positive reviews on Trip Advisor recently. How do you feel about this achievement?Stavros: Appreciate you for having me on-board. I feel obliged and extremely happy to see that our hard work is paying off.KD: How has the Hospitality industry in Cyprus and Greece been performing over the years?Stavros: With the turbulence in the general Mediterranean area, and with the bad media attention specific to Cyprus and Greece in the past couple of years, the whole industry was in a very difficult situation. Thankfully, the worst storm has passed! We can now be hopeful about the future again and proudly say that 2016 has been one of the most successful years in the history of Cyprian and Greek hospitality so far.KD: So tell us more about Cyprotels Hotels & Resorts. What are the unique features of the hotels that make it so special for your guests?Stavros: We don’t think we have any unique features, it is just that we give special attention and care to every single guest. We strive to be the best at what we do in our region. For this, we have designed family orientated all-inclusive holiday packages. We focus on keeping the kids busy in their games, while their parents can enjoy a well-deserved break during the stay. We also ensure that a scrumptious spread is available which can cater to the needs of different age groups and ethnic backgrounds. Besides, we have followed a “mixed-age grouping” approach in our staffing, and the members are accordingly aligned with the guests.KD: In the fast-paced industry, there are several hotel revenue management technology requirements. Does it help you in any manner to have one vendor for all your requirements?Stavros: Yes, everyone enjoys a one-stop shop for all their needs. We save a tremendous amount of time not having to switch between different websites and/or apps. It makes our life much easier and in case there are any issues, we don’t have to speak to 4-5 different support teams to resolve the issues, which is amazing!KD: Can you elaborate a little on how hospitality is shifting towards being more needs-focused?Stavros: I wouldn’t read it as a desire to be needs-focused, and would rather tag it as a shift towards being “more transparent”. Today, guest sentiment analysis matters and their opinions are all out in the open, thanks to the numerous review sites out there. People talk about their wants and a huge number of people want the same thing, hence being transparent is a necessity for hotels. RateGain’s BrandGain is a very useful tool in this regard, as it helps us to identify these requirements. By using it, we are able to analyze our guest’s sentiments and accordingly cater to their exact requirements.KD: How has RateGain helped you in your journey?Stavros: It has been a long and hard road to reach where we are today and we never used technology like this before! Besides, it is always hard to change a long-standing culture. But I must say that the team at RateGain has stood by us right from the start. They have willingly walked us through our issues and unusual situations. Not sure if we were actually spoiled by the account managers we had, (laughs) I am sure they have worked in this industry before becoming a part of RateGain, as they are always ready with a series of valuable insights. The tools themselves are brilliant and the people helping us to use them have been guiding us through all the features. This has made our journey a lot smoother.Those were some really kind words!

Thank you for taking out your valuable time for the Brilliant Hotelier series. I would like to congratulate the entire team of Prime Plaza Hotels and Resorts on completing so many successful years in this business. How does it feel to be one of the veterans in the Indonesian hospitality business today?Thank you for the kind words! Well, with so many years of operation in the hotel industry, new challenges become inevitable for properties in this region, and ours is no exception. But human resource remains the main area of challenge and in order to resolve it, one has to apply new methodologies. Working with the millennial generation is easy as they are a tech-savvy lot and have grown up around gadgets and gizmos. But the main challenge is getting the older generation to work, for they are reluctant to step outside their comfort zone.Nevertheless, we are devoted towards making use of eCommerce and online marketing channels. These are dynamic fields and we have to maintain a demand proactive attitude while implementing them. Only then we can keep up the latest hospitality technology trends and in the end, lead our competitive set.Tell us more about how your service defines ‘The Signature of Indonesian Hospitality’. What are the special amenities offered under your banner for business and leisure travelers?‘The Signature of Indonesian Hospitality’ is our motto and this tag-line keeps us motivated at all times since it revolves around the total service delivery. Customer satisfaction and hospitality is the incessant behavior and a gift of the Indonesian people. So, you can presume that good service is already present in our DNA. The amenities that we offer are no different from our competitors in the region, rather it is our service quality and guest oriented interaction that sets us apart. Hence we try to satisfy our guests by anticipating their needs in advance and offering them services which stretch beyond their expectations.Competitive positioning is about defining how you’ll differentiate your offerings and your hotel online. How does a good Hotel online reputation management tool help you manage your branding?The maturity of digital portals and a plethora of social forums today have made information transparent and accessible in a few clicks. The core challenge is to determine the level of discretion when it comes to sharing data online, and a smart reputation management program like BrandGain makes that easy for us. So far, your team has done a great job in managing our hotel’s online reputation.Every staff member in a hotel should be well aware of certain discretion levels. After all, the ultimate goal is guest satisfaction and it eventually becomes the main marketing ammunition in today’s online battlefield and helps a hotel win customers over its competition.In order to redefine your customer’s experience, we understand that you have crafted a wide range of special offers for them. Please elaborate more on a few new ones.We have some innovative offers to entice customers so that they can book directly, instead of taking the OTA route. For example, we roll out bundled promotions which include minimum night stays and discounts on all out hotel outlets. In order to enrich the visitor’s experience, we have revamped our website, following which we were able to grow customer engagement that can boost the overall conversion.We have also tried RateGain’s industry leading suite of products, which in my opinion are very innovative. The Bundle Offer or Unified Revenue Management comes with a lot of features and is competitively priced as well. We have tried similar solutions in the past from other vendors but were not satisfied with the results.Image Credit: Prime Plaza Hotels and ResortsWhat is your take on today’s smart hospitality technology solutions? Are hotels in your region proactively embracing them in the form of Unified Revenue Management Suites?The rapid adoption of open source technology solutions has made technology highly available and more affordable today. But we need to be very diligent while choosing the right solution partner.  I think every hotel is looking at an integrated and efficient platform that collates data, which is in silos. In my opinion, a good hotel Revenue Management System should have the capability to predict the future and keep a hotel in the forefront.Some Indonesian hoteliers believe that current hotel pricing trends are mirroring the trends of the quick, dynamic, and unpredictable Forex Trading Market. So the idea is to have a principle based hotel pricing algorithm that encompasses fundamental revenue management concepts as well as technical data analysis applications. Only then a hotel can arrive at a smart pricing decision and RateGain does exactly this for us. Since it’s an industry trend, I am sure other hotels in the region are also doing the same.How has RateGain helped you in your journey till date?So far, our journey with RateGain has been very satisfactory. Unity – the unified revenue management suite renders a seamless, organized and completely integrated reporting for our 11 hotel-unit property. We are looking forward to leveraging all the other features, innovations and dynamic reporting functionalities of Unity in the near future. On a similar note, we have been considering a revision in our revenue management culture so as to refurbish our understanding of good revenue management practices in-house.That is amazing!

65632940a3f6fc78b8eba2fe,-473545435,How to Increase Hotel Direct Bookings? Don’t Ignore the Role of a Booking Engine,"September 26, 2016","‘Hey, could you help me get the best deal in one of the hotels in town?’ ‘Could you please share the number of some leading travel agents, who could help me plan my accommodation at economical prices?’ ‘Oh, it is such a time-consuming process, I should have planned well in advance to get a better deal for the hotel’Well, gone are those days and these statements are quite unheard of in the current scenario, where the entire world seems to have moved online or on mobile. Technology has changed gears at an amazing speed – something we had never imagined before. Needless to say, our lifestyles have also undergone a dramatic change, as we look for increased convenience, in just a click!Definitely, there is a multitude of choice available to a traveler, for booking accommodation. People are now rarely seen calling travel agents to book a travel or a stay. Apart from this, a host of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) offer these services in quite a streamlined fashion, making the lives of travelers relatively relaxed, also giving them a platform to compare different hotels and their services.However, a shift in trend has been witnessed lately, as many hotels are experiencing a significant upsurge in bookings coming directly, without any involvement from OTAs. This is clear from the latest revelations that 65.4% of hotel bookings are being made directly and only 19.5% of the overall hotel bookings are being made through intermediaries (Statistic Brain). This will definitely help hotels increase their RevPAR.The trend has taken off well in 2016 – let us see what the remaining few months of the year have in store. Is a new trend going to emerge in the industry, or this one is here to stay – it’s a wait-and-watch game!In the current scenario, the websites of most hotels allow their customers to book their stay directly with them. Well, it is important because an alarmingly high number of people now plan their travel online. But how does this work for hotels?Making reservations directly would never have been possible without the use of an efficient booking engine, which is well integrated with the hotel’s website. Besides making the booking process simpler for the guests, it helps drive large profit margins, and hotels end up saving huge commissions, which they otherwise pay to OTAs.So, it is important for all hotels, big or small, to invest in a competent booking engine, which induces travelers to book their stay with them. Without its use, hotels might lose out on direct bookings, thus closing the main revenue stream and also losing share in the eyes of travelers. They could be left far behind in the race… winning might seem tough, as the overall response is likely to go tepid, pushing the company in doldrums.So, hoteliers all over the world have been relooking at their booking strategy and working out ways to secure more online direct reservations with minimum effort and cost. However, Online Reputation Management has a significant role to play to drive more direct hotel bookings. It makes perfect sense for them to invest in building up reliable, up-to-date direct booking engines, which betters the customer experience further. Being a key investment and a need of the hour for the hotels, it can increase their revenues by leaps and bounds and also help build a long-term relationship with the guests.Now, what should be the key features of an ideal booking engine?Booking is the ‘first’ interface of the guest in the hotel. And ‘firsts’ usually lay the grounds for the rest of the journey. ‘Firsts’ are known to sometimes make, or even break. So, why not invest our effort in making, and not breaking? A huge opportunity for hoteliers, it is time for them to come forward and strengthen their booking engines to become the drivers of growth and the masters of ‘firsts’.",https://rategain.com/blog/how-to-increase-hotel-direct-bookings-dont-ignore-the-role-of-a-booking-engine/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/drive-direct-bookings-1024x512-1024x512.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/drive-direct-bookings-1024x512-1024x512.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Price intelligence,Revenue Management,,,,,,0
65632943a3f6fc78b8eba300,606487830,Weary of Disruption? 5 Simple Steps to Disrupt the Disruptions in the Rapidly Changing Hospitality Industry,"September 21, 2016","Disruptors in the global hotel industry – everything from home-sharing sites like Airbnb, Tujia, HomeAway, BnB Hero and Roomorama, to OTAs and other new sets of investors, have been rapidly carrying out acquisitions. They have been able to successfully create a torment in travel and hospitality landscape.But instead of focusing on how to battle disruptors through legislation and PR, hoteliers, chain executives and operators should start thinking about doing some disruption of their own!It is time to should stop worrying about the effects of disruptions and instead focus on how to outdo these upstarts. Here are five simple steps to disrupt the disruptions in the rapidly changing hospitality industry. #1 The debate about who owns the guest occupies center stage!Hotels have a limited choice now regarding whether or not to distribute to OTAs. However, the ownership of the guest has become a challenge. A couple of OTAs announced last year that they would cease to provide hotels with the guest’s email when it sends guest confirmation. When a hotel fails to access guest data readily, the OTA “owns” the guest. This hampers a hotel’s ability to capture new as well as repeat guests with the highest value.Although we can’t ignore the OTAs too for source specific markets unless our own Brand.com is strong enough to pull direct business, hotels require data for effective marketing so as to past guests and access data to churn this further. Train front desk staff to collect data from guests at check in, and concentrate on growing all direct channels along with OTA contribution. This will ensure that the guests are owned by the hotel too.#2 Mobile marketing and mobile commerce are set to revolutionize the industry.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""wp-image-3023 size-large"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/o-YOUNG-PEOPLE-ON-MOBILE-facebook-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Image Credit: Huffpost"" width=""640"" height=""427"" />In 2016, 51.8% of travelers who book trips via digital means will do so using a mobile device, according to eMarketer’s latest estimates of digital and travel research and booking. That will be up from 43.8% this year. Clearly, a robust mobile marketing plan is in order. This means responsive design, one-click booking, and location technology. Some hotels are surprised to hear that a comprehensive mobile marketing plan calls for integrating click-to-call campaigns.According to Google’s “The Role of Click to Call in the Path to Purchase,” 68% of hotel guests report that it is extremely/very important to be able to call a hotel during the purchase phase, and 58% are very likely to call a hotel if the capability is available in a smartphone search. Of those who are likely to call directly from search, 40% will call to make a purchase, and 50% will call to ask about promotions or incentives. Like other segments of the online marketplace, mobile is playing an increasingly important role in online travel. Guests typically take a cross-platform approach, so it is essential that hotels offer a seamless Omni-channel experience before, during and after their stay.#3 Market share shifts mean more competition.From 2014 to 2015 ADR grew 5.2%, RevPAR grew 7.2%, and occupancy grew 2%, according to a June 2015 PKF Hospitality Research report. However, supply in the top 59 metropolitan markets is projected to increase 3.1%, and hotels are beginning to see more competition from private accommodations, especially as vacation rentals and alternative accommodations become widely available across traditional OTA channels. The increasingly competitive market requires hotels to craft strategies around capturing more market share. Strategies include:#4 Guest acquisition costs continue to rise!OTAs are capturing an increasing market share, and commissions are rising at twice the rate of revenue growth, according to the recently there has been concern that the Billboard Effect no longer exists. To offset rising commissions, hotels must shore up reservation sales to ensure that valuable phone channel reservations are maximized to the fullest.“Based on an average of stay values, phone reservations bring in 38% more revenue than OTA’s and almost 9% more than web reservations.”To make sure that a voice channel reservation value is maintained, hotels need to implement call tracking, regular coaching, and reward reservation alongside the usual performance-based incentives.#5 Understand how travelers are changing to use data to put their needs first.Know your travelers. Last-minute trips are on the rise, and more people are planning on a last-minute trip in the coming year. The short local getaway and mini-vacations will continue to trend. Leisure will continue to grow, according to Fortune, and we predict that multi-generational and multi-family travel will experience growth, as well.By looking at historical booking data, we can see that bookings are tied to keywords and search queries that drove the bookings. This is a goldmine of data in the CRM itself which can integrate data from a plethora of online and offline sources. This information helps us to dig deep into a channel of guests, their behavior as well as their reservation department, where the revenue is present for the development of a plan that is informed by real guests, so as to weed out unnecessary steps driven by what the hotel identifies as profitable.Using these key techniques, industry leaders can wrest back control of their destiny in the travel and hospitality hemisphere.<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3029"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Kamesh.jpg"" alt=""Ka"" width=""1016"" height=""433"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/weary-of-disruption-5-simple-steps-to-disrupt-the-disruptions-in-the-rapidly-changing-hospitality-industry/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disruption3-420x210.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disruption3-420x210.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/o-YOUNG-PEOPLE-ON-MOBILE-facebook-1024x683.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Kamesh.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Hospitality trends,Revenue Management,,,,,,0
65632947a3f6fc78b8eba302,1580315531,Disruption in the Hotel Industry and Changing Face of the Global Travel Market,"September 16, 2016","Influence of the modern day traveler has disrupted the monotone within the hospitality industry by giving rise to a wave of innovative ideas, ingenious solutions and permanent changes. Despite the amount of vulnerabilities faced by the global travel market, it has been expanding at a rapid pace. According to PhoCusWright, the industry will add $206 billion in gross bookings in the next four years, with two-thirds of the growth coming from emerging markets.In this regard, recently in an opening presentation titled “Disruption’s curve,” PhoCusWright executives discussed some forces that could change the travel industry’s trajectory in the coming years, namely computing devices, mobile, delight, sharing economy and the future consumer.As technology developments unfold at such relentless speeds – hotels and other hospitality setups have to keep up with the revolution. Accordingly, managers and directors should keep a tab on and track the below trends, which are not only the fundamental techniques to curb disruption in hospitality but have also brought forth a revolution!Let’s have a look at some of the pointers that are rapidly changing the face of the global hospitality and travel market.“You Can Ignore the Facts; You Can’t Deny the Facts” – Barack Hussein Obama IIThe advent of the internet of things (IoT), coupled with smartphones as discussed earlier, has granted customers with a better access to plan, book, and control travel from remote locations. This caused the fall of traditional travel agents and was perfectly outlined in Thomas Cook’s $243 million loss in Q1, 2012. On the other hand, Airbnb closed a $475 million funding round at a reported $10 billion valuation last year, but less than a year later the sharing economy standard-bearer was worth over double, $25.5 billion to be specific. Priceline acquired meta-search provider Kayak, for $1.8 billion in 2013, and in 2014, SAP bought Concur, a business travel and expense management software provider for over $8 billion.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""wp-image-2953 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/accenture-hospitality-image-map.jpg"" alt=""hospitality image map"" width=""993"" height=""555"" />This throws light on the fact that disruption also comes with a huge amount of optimism, thereby indicating that travel and hospitality sectors are about to undergo a huge transformation in the near future. This is reinventing the complete customer lifecycle – right from booking to hotel-stay experience, to check out and beyond. So instead of becoming digitally disrupted, hotels have to become the digital disruptors themselves by delivering a unified guest experience to their patrons.",https://rategain.com/blog/disruption-in-the-hotel-industry-and-changing-face-of-the-global-travel-market/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fdg-440x220.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fdg-440x220.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/accenture-hospitality-image-map.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Personalization,,,,,,,0

6563294ca3f6fc78b8eba306,-1155731879,"Hotels, Are You Prepared for Digital Detox Travelers?","September 6, 2016","“We do not have Wi-Fi…talk to each other. Pretend it is 1995.” read a Café board in Annapolis, Maryland, a picture of which went viral on Facebook in December 2015.What makes cafés and restaurants put up such displays nowadays? These are supposed to be places where colleagues, friends, and families connect over a bite or a drink. But well, the first question from a customer who walks in today goes, “Do you have Wi-Fi?” The vibrant spaces where people once interacted and forged bonds now look, feel and sound like digital libraries, thanks to our dependence on technology.We keep our eyes so fixed on our cell phones and laptops all the time. But even while the current generation is mostly tech-dependent and cannot afford to disconnect from their gadgets, they’ve surprisingly begun to differ, in thought and action. Their fast-paced lives, obsession with being online and the information deluge incessantly hitting them makes them crave a respite. For a limpid break of sorts, they usually reckon leisure traveling, coupled with a ‘digital detox’ that is a good remedy.Internet overload has led millions of people in the UK to take a “digital detox”, according to research from regulator Ofcom. The study of 2,025 adults and 500 teenagers forms part of Ofcom’s annual Communications Market Report, which assesses the state of the digital nation.But, what is a ‘Digital Detox’?Digital detox is an act of taking time off from the digitally addicted lifestyle much of today’s population is habitual to. One needs to switch off all their gadgets to enjoy the screen-free time while exploring more active alternatives of enjoyment.Statistics reveal how the sentiment of a ‘tech-free break’ is now snowballing and catching the fancy of today’s traveler. And why not? Wasn’t it time?The Ofcom’s Communications Market Report, 2016, reveals that one in three adult internet users have sought a period of up to a month offline, with one in ten admitting to having done so as recently as the previous week. For a third of the people studied in the report, staying online for too long prods them to go for a complete break offline.Travelers are turning off their mobiles and dropping out their Internet connections. The Digital Detox Holiday Momentum is picking up!!!What this Trend Means for the Travel IndustryA lot! For the information overloaded travelers of today, a popular way of detoxifying is leisure travel. And, people are much more likely to frequent national and international visits today than they did in the past. International tourist arrivals shot up by 4.4% in 2015 reaching a record total of 1,184 million, the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, May 2016 reported. Around 50 million more tourists traveled to international destinations around the world last year as compared to 2014. Another report by eMarketerer in July 2016 predicted that the growing appetite for leisure travel among the middle-class travelers, particularly those from developing countries, will drive the global expenditure on digitally booked trips to reach a whopping $817 Billion by 2020.So we can say that an increase in traveling trends especially leisure traveling, will continue.Digital Detox Holidays are seen as a good time to switch off with 16% of travelers choosing destinations with no internet access and 9% actively seeking places with no mobile signal.What lies in it for the Hotels.Are you a digital Detox Hotel? While hotels have been busy devising innovative ways to serve the tech-savvy generation, now is the time to up the game a bit and tap into a whole new market. A market of digital detox enthusiasts! One can begin by taking baby steps, even as more strategic plans are brought into action. For one, hotels can offer exclusive stay arrangements for guests seeking a tech break to prioritize their booking preferences.Social media makes adult internet users feel sociable but brings out the opposite in them. It makes them lose the real-world connection with each other. A report by HVS Global Hospitality Services 2013 revealed that 58% of millennials prefer traveling in groups. So yes, travelers prefer company. But are they ‘sociable’? They aren’t. Addiction to technology keeps them from doing so.That is a gap a travel expert can bridge. By creating opportunities where travelers can interact with like-minded people. A company called Contiki, makes millennials meet other millennials, often from different countries, intelligently creating unique stays to tap on guest satisfaction.Hotel guests today are bombarded with the what-not of food, clothing, gadgets, and whatever you name. While varying choices and facilities add to the comfort that hotels try to bring, simplifying their guests’ lives is another responsibility they need to shoulder. Doing so can actually help hotels aid the ‘detox’. Something as simple as limiting the variety of food items to only the most authentic cuisine on the menu can make guests’ feel sorted. Sometimes, a flavor of the good old, simple times is all they need for a refreshing vacation.Some hotels have taken the lead by requesting guests to switch off their phones during a leisure stay. But you can’t leave it at that. Alternatives of enjoyment and connecting with people must be provided. Engaging activities as a part of guest sentiment analysis, such as dance, music and yoga workshops, relaxing massages and hobby classes for cooking and crafts can act as perfect icebreakers! Thailand offers a few accommodation options that offer similar kind of non-digital experience. Providing avid readers with libraries and reading clubs is another way of bringing back to these wanderers the pure joy of book reading. Even something as simple as a bonfire arrangement for a group of hotel guests can give them an experience memorable enough to consider their next trip to the same hotel for their digital detox vacation.While some hotel brands have pushed as far as offering robotic bellhops to tech-savvy visitors, now is a ripe time to slow down. To embrace the ‘tech-free’ wave and re-evaluate the changes in visitors’ tastes. Travelers are humans first. More than anything else, they will always cherish a tranquil connection with reality, nature and themselves. Wouldn’t they?Did you find this post helpful?

We asked him a few questions regarding his experiences with our product suite, which we thought would be of help to other hotel revenue management professionals. Here’s what Neil had to say.Q1. Kindly advise us on any challenge(s) that you have faced before implementing RateGain as a solution?As we were a new hotel management company that was taking over an existing property, we did not have a proper tool to assist us in our revenue management strategy.Q2. What improvements did you notice after implementing our solutions? If possible, could you please advise on the exact benefits drawn by you?We took over an existing property, which was already being managed by another management company. At this point, we did not have any solution to assist us in daily revenue decisions. The immediate benefit we received was that we were able to position the property strategically among our comp-set as far as pricing was concerned. We were able to save time and efforts using the competitive price intelligence tool, and also providing us the confidence to manage rates multiple times during the day. With considerable data now on record, the price optimization tool is now a strong reference guide in our pricing decisions.Q3. How easy it is to use RateGain’s suite of products and how the system has made your life easier?The rate shopping tool is very user-friendly with the pages being very easy to maneuver across. It has definitely saved us time during the day to focus on selling.Q4. Why did you choose to go with RateGain products, compared to the plethora of solutions available in the market?The fact the rate shopping solution was providing real-time data compared to other products, was a key factor. Also, the offer of getting a package with multiple tools, including online reputation management, was what attracted us to go ahead with RateGain.Q5: What is the best feature/application of RateGain’s solution?The Hotel Price Optimization application is the best feature.That was a captivating dialogue!

65632952a3f6fc78b8eba30a,1578889325,How Hotels of Tomorrow are Improving Guest Experience with Technology?,"September 1, 2016","Technology has made inroads into the lives of all in an unbelievably magical way, with almost every industry progressing at a rapid pace with its constant deployment. Having already transformed the landscape of the hospitality industry, the rapid use of technology has taken customer experience to the next level, by ensuring that the ever-evolving expectations of the guests are being met. The future looks certainly different and exciting, with more innovations waiting down the road, accommodating the fast paced lifestyles of the masses.Needless to say, the hotels of today are fairly advanced as compared to the hotels of yesterday. And going forward, with the current widespread technology revolution, the hotels of tomorrow will be unique in their own ways, bringing a whole new breath of fresh air for travelers. The future lies with the technology-equipped hotels, which are going to lead the race, benefiting the industry with increased hotel bookings, increased RevPAR and ADR; thereby generating more revenue for hotels.In this current age of non-stop innovation and disruption, the needs and demands of the travelers are also evolving, where they look forward to a more personalized experience now, while also demanding relevant and meaningful information, presented to them in the most simplified manner. The increased use of the mobile app, website, and social media in hospitality is already playing a big role in indulging with the guests, aiming to heighten their experiences. It is important for the revenue managers of the hotels to well optimize all the available channels, so that the potential guests are easily able to locate the hotel, without any trouble.Globally, various countries are technologically superior and are strongly driving growth on the basis of innovation. Hosts of facilities are already being offered by the hoteliers like tech-enabled rooms providing Wi-Fi, independent iPad, etc. The check-in methods have also evolved, with mobile phones typically acting as room keys for the guests, giving them the freedom to choose their rooms and even unlock their doors using their mobile devices. What’s more, they can even review and settle their final bills using their smartphone. All this helps them skip the cumbersome front office interactions, thus saving them a lot of time spent in check-in formalities.The concierge services in some of the hotels also seem to have taken an online avatar, where a whole range of information like area maps, flight information, entertainment options in the city, etc. is straightaway shared on the guests’ smartphones. Well, everything seems to be at the fingertips of the travelers.Most of the hotels are also upgrading their direct booking software, as globally, 65.4% of bookings take place through the hotel’s direct website than via OTAs and other third-party channels (Statistic Brain). Bookings through mobile have grown by leaps and bounds, and in overall travel, they have grown by 1700% between 2011 and 2015, moving from 1% to 18% of online revenues (Frederic Gonzalo, 2016). The last-minute booking software is also being made robust since estimates reveal that 65% of the tourists book hotel reservations for the same day on a mobile device.A huge opportunity to tap, certainly!Undoubtedly, the digital age hotels are investing hugely in systems and technologies and also generating greater revenues. Morgan Stanley Research estimated that the global hotel industry saw revenues of $570 billion last year. The hotels of today are leaving no stone unturned to stay extra connected with the guest, right from the stage when they start planning their travel till the time they finally bid adieu. For this cause, hotels are opting for seamlessly integrated multiple systems and are working towards providing greater automation and self-service options to the guests, adding choice, convenience and value to their stay. The trend is surely going to stay in the future as well, with forward-thinking hotels already anticipating the next game-changing trends well in advance and preparing for the future accordingly. This approach is important, as any negligent service more often than not, might lead to consumer fatigue and boredom linked to unimaginative or needless choices and will eventually impact hotel’s bottom-line.Yes, the definition of customer experience in the hospitality industry has changed beyond expectations and imagination. However, it would be bizarre to even think that the role of the human element and personal interactions with the staff is dwindling. In fact, rather than acting as a substitute for customer service, technology actually complements the existing hotel services to deliver a WOW!!! experience to the guests, thus building long-term relations, and in turn increasing hotel sales.With seeds of change being sown each day, the hotels of today are striving hard to provide utmost comfort and convenience to their guests and become a perfect ‘home away from home’ destination for travelers, by nourishing the sprouts of technology every now and then.The ultimate aim is to drive value to both, the travelers and to the hotel. Perhaps, it is the beginning of a silent revolution in the hotel industry. Watch this space a few years from now. A few bright stars will come up and would make a mark universally by following the “new way” of doing hospitality business driven solely by guest experience and technology.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2897 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eBook-Banner.jpg"" alt=""hotel-revenue-customer-loyalty"" width=""400"" height=""250"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/how-hotels-of-tomorrow-are-improving-guest-experience-with-technology/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fg-584x292.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fg-584x292.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eBook-Banner.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632954a3f6fc78b8eba30c,51265935,How can Hotels Generate More Revenue from Customer Loyalty - Part II,"August 25, 2016","In the first part of this blog post, we have read about interesting ways to cash on customer loyalty.Every hotel or travel business is dependent on its customers for churning revenue. While hoteliers must be already thinking along these lines, but we can’t ignore the fact that an existing client pool is always the easiest, profitable and most predictable source of revenue for a hotel.In all conscience, customer loyalty is not an alien concept in the hospitality industry, for this industry has played a pivotal role in inventing customer experience and loyalty programs. Every revenue strategy envisioned today by leading hotel chain owners, ranging from star-ratings to brand consistency, focuses on creating a positive guest experience.So the fundamental idea is that every existing and loyal customer knows all about your brand and is easier to please than new prospects.Forbes magazine recently revealed that acquiring new customers costs five times more than retaining existing ones. So, hoteliers must figure out ways to attract and retain current customers, for it is a more cost-effective procedure than constantly marketing to new customers.Connect with the most valuable guestsFoster satisfaction and loyalty to guarantee future revenue of your hotel business. This step will make it easier to get repeat business as well as attract new customers (especially the ones who follow ratings and reviews). But the point in the discussion is, as an hotelier, how should you practice targeted customer loyalty to bring in the biggest value over a guest’s lifetime?For this, you have to get a holistic view of a guest’s lifetime value, not their room-rate spend to understand the most valuable customer. To do such an all-inclusive assessment, integrate data from all transaction systems to get the true picture of a guest’s preferred activity & choices and of course their feedback too.Inspire long term loyalty amongst already loyal patronsAfter you identify the most valuable guests, put strategies in place and make these guests feel highly welcomed and special and not just welcomed at your hotel. Give out VIP check-ins, free Wi-Fi, include other items (such as champagne, chocolates or flowers), treat them with a complimentary spa treatment, mini-bar in the room, etc. Such tactics throw light and emphasis on the fact that a guest’s patronage is acknowledged and valued by the hotel.End of the day, it is a hotel revenue manager’s job to assign better pricing and room types to a loyal guest. While carrying out the task, they have to keep three things in mind:In case the revenue management funnel is perfect, a hotel’s marketing or customer service department has to attract the money-spinning client pool. After all, it is the improved treatment of top guests through special booking processes, which can drive revenue targeted customer loyalty.Role of the Marketing DepartmentIntegration of decisions from revenue managers and marketing departments is crucial for any hotel. Bringing both sides on the table can help retain guests effectively, provided real-time data accessibility is available. On the basis of this data, campaigns can be created which will eventually foster customer loyalty strongly.Further, on the basis of forecasted demand, targeted promotional campaigns can be designed for the specified market segment, which will for sure ensure demand generation. So that the right decisions about pricing and promotions are made, which will lead to more revenue.The dynamic hospitality landscape is constantly leading to re-orientation of roles and responsibilities across revenue, marketing, and all other departments. Based on these changes, hoteliers have to build an innovative revenue management culture, in order to come up with a fact-based guidance and more learned strategy, which will further maximize their revenue opportunities.Hence recognizing the most valuable guests, fostering them and setting the best possible prices can lead to the timely analysis and determination of top promotional funnels. All such campaigns will eventually attract repeat customers, develop lifetime loyalty and finally get the revenue bells ringing for your hotel.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2897 size-full"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eBook-Banner.jpg"" alt=""hotel-revenue-customer-loyalty"" width=""400"" height=""250"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/how-can-hotels-generate-more-revenue-from-customer-loyalty-part-ii/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/make-hotel-revenue-customer-loyalty-1430x715.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/make-hotel-revenue-customer-loyalty-1430x715.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eBook-Banner.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
65632957a3f6fc78b8eba30e,555843066,How can Hotels Generate More Revenue from Customer Loyalty - Part I,"August 19, 2016","What is the key opportunity in the hospitality industry that can help your hotel generate more revenue in 2016? It is customer loyalty. Industry trends demonstrate that it is easier to convert current customers than to look out for new ones. In the online space today, where ad impressions, clicks and conversions are getting costlier with every minute, acquiring new customers is an expensive exercise. So selling more to existing clients sounds feasible for hospitality and travel companies of all sizes.A recent survey by a leading research firm – Software Advice – revealed that “30% of millennials prefer earning points based on the money they spend at the restaurant’’ .This rings a bell somewhere!Your customer is open to shop at a competitor happily, which is not acceptable for your business goals! On these lines, many hotels try to create a loyalty program by primarily offering specials through newsletters. Rewards are a good method to acknowledge loyalty and also drive buying behavior. But, in case a business wants to leverage loyalty from clients, they need to make sure that the customers are repeatable, profitable and do more than make purchase offers based on past purchases.This throws light on the fact that – loyalty creates a very strong relationship amidst customers and businesses, but price does not drive loyalty. Rather perceived value of the product or inventory drives the same! Now you may hurriedly ask yourself, when did you last re-engage your current customers with loyalty goodies? If you have, did any of them come back?If you are inclined towards leveraging customer loyalty to boost your revenue bottom line, ensure that customers believe your business offers value for money and they “know that you love them”! Here are a few cool strategies that influence your current client base to purchase more frequently, by relying on inside sales, up-selling, and marketing additional services.Transactional value will follow automatically! In order to ensure that customers keep coming back, you can try to offer attractive incentives to specific targets, for example, families with children. Remember that the one-off profit made on an average sale is not related to the aggregate profit of an average customer that is represented by a business relationship. You have to recognize these combined profits followed by the time, effort and expenses going behind every loyal customer’s retention strategy.By introducing ‘Customers who booked this room also bought’ on a hotel website and ‘Frequently clubbed together’ or a ‘Discounted second booking’, you can churn out a lot of revenue! These cross-selling geniuses are neat ways to absolve customers from hard-selling whiffs. The same can be incorporated into your brand website. Automation of such recommendations is better than manual uploads onto a hotel’s portal. It also helps you save time and divert attention towards inventory sales.Suggest complementary products or catchy service offers in these pop-ups. What do your customers look for? What are the add-on needs that their bookings trigger? Remember that offering complementary products will surely help you to expand your gross margins by almost 25%!Though you invest heavily in laying the foundation initially, your acquired customer relationships go unattended which make these clients lose interest over time. Sometimes, your brand might get abandoned for a competitor. Detecting this bleeding point at the right time and stopping the leakage can actually help you double or triple your growth rate!“96% of dissatisfied customers don’t complain.” – Marketing WizdomIf your customers are walking away without a hint, then it is your job to find out why.

6563295ca3f6fc78b8eba310,-1771171837,5 Things About Hotel Revenue Management Your Boss Wants to Know – Part II,"July 28, 2016","Hope you have gone through and implemented what we had shared in Part I of this blog series. Now you will agree that a revenue manager has to put on several hats in this role. Considering the complexity of their job role, a revenue manager can be rightfully termed as a – forecaster, strategist, system design specialist, data analyst, marketing guru, talent manager, social media expert, data miner, sales support and also a channel manager. There’s a lot going on in his head on a typical day at job!As a matter of fact, it is always challenging to analyze and decipher the seemingly endless amount of data and not overlook the big picture, while coming up with a comprehensive and innovative revenue generation strategy for profit maximization.In order to help SRMs (whom we have termed them as ‘smart revenue managers’ in this blog) stay on track, here’s a list of some more interesting tips which will blow your boss’s mind away for sure!1. The ability to tell apples from oranges: For any hotel that is setting up benchmarks in the market, they need to understand the basic differences between their benchmarked product and the competitor’s product.For example, my deluxe suite has a certain size in square feet and contains several amenities. Here, I have to trace out the best comparable product from my competitor’s inventory. Thereafter, I have to focus on the competitor’s product packaging.For any seasoned revenue manager, the definition of benchmark is set according to the guest’s needs. In that case, the SRM should adopt a smart approach by talking to guests, studying historical booking data, forecasting future pricing data and also deriving budget buckets.Such buckets will allow the SRM to benchmark all hotel offerings at par with competitor offerings. Besides, they can make some value points by meeting the target-guest-pool’s budget constraints.2. Demand forecasting and demand mapping go hand in hand: Every hotel has a set of distribution partners, who can roughly predict the property’s business pattern.In order to effectively analyze all business operations and predict every possible revenue stream, the SRM needs to examine historical booking data as well as study the guest source markets. Thereafter, the results need to be mapped against ongoing demand of the hotel in its present location.Such a gap analysis helps revenue managers identify fresh markets and recognize demand partners. In the end, it opens the doors for additional business.3. Collide head-on with the issue to resolve it: Doubts about the authenticity of online guest reviews will never fade out. Yet, the impact of guest feedback received on a hotel’s brand website or Social media page, is always treated as “reliable information” by potential guests.Hotels across the globe have lately realized that online guest reviews are important! After all, potential holiday-goers apply the “law of averages” when it comes to analyzing online feedback/reviews. Even a single negative review cannot be kept unaddressed. Otherwise, the hotel’s complete value perception gets impacted.This value perception has a huge role to play, when it comes to rate evaluation, causing hotels to track and respond to reviews via smart sentiment analysis tools. After all, if a hotel shoots to fame, then the resulting revenue is due to the benefits reaped from favorable traveler reviews.These sentiments can be analyzed by an SRM to come up with a Value Index (VI) or a comparative index to build a proper rate decision-making process.4. Historical data is not the only basis of forecasting anymore: While most hotels still rely heavily on historical data, basing pricing decisions and forecasting demand by this method only gives inaccurate results. As an alternative, hoteliers syndicate future competitor rates with competitor-based Value Index (VI) as well as keep an eye on other demand related variables.As and when new events and actions take place, strategies based on historical event-action configurations render favored consequences. Besides, combining current events with information provides new opportunities and endless possibilities.5. Customer Lifetime Value is the holy-grail for your hotel: Smart revenue managers have to look out for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). They have to note down all the changes that make one genuine difference, which is not a hype or illusion. Gauging consumer & market dynamics clearly and identifying the exact compset, will help your hotels to efficiently process greater bookings and pricing data. Encouraging loyalty behavior through reward program investments helps boosts CLV.Time is ripe for a revolution in revenue management. Go ahead and take a big leap into the world of predictive, big data driven, revenue management strategies and bid goodbye to historical demand-driven practices.By incorporating all the previously discussed approaches (in case you missed part I of this blog, click here), your hotel will surge ahead of the competition and generate more revenue, provided you roll out the strategies with a careful combination of technology, agility and analysis.",https://rategain.com/blog/top-5-things-about-hotel-revenue-management-your-boss-wants-to-know/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-900x450.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Demand forecasting,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Revenue Management,,,,0
6563295ea3f6fc78b8eba312,1398194092,5 Things About Hotel Revenue Management Your Boss Wants to Know - Part I,"July 22, 2016","In the super dynamic and highly connected digital world today, it is tough for a hotel to earn its bragging rights. Also, revving up the overall hospitality play and standing out in the crowd is not a cake walk, considering the high level of competition in the industry. Rapidly shifting consumer landscape further adds to the pressure, by disrupting customer research patterns and interaction levels, with hospitality or travel brands.In such a scenario, any revenue manager would get perplexed, as he or she has to look for fresh rules, and yet not once neglect the “last-minute pricing” thumb rule. As a revenue manager, you are also expected to analyze linked distribution channels. This reveals the prevalence of an ongoing paradigm shift from price sensitivity, towards convenience or guest satisfaction and availability.On this note, let’s dig deeper into some important Hotel Revenue Management strategies, which will surely impress your boss!The below listed points syndicate latest technology and key mantras, and are critical as far as profit maximization is concerned!On a serious note, it is rare to get a competitive advantage simply by implementing a revenue management tool. As an adept professional, what you do differently and how effectively you make use of your Revenue Management System is what helps your hotel outsmart its competition. Keep reading for more insights!#1. Business IntelligenceYour approach towards business intelligence is going to drive your decision making capability. So you have to decide early on all your key performance indicators or KPIs.Characteristically, a KPI addresses your hotel’s needs as well as all its bleeding points.Therefore, it is important for you as a Revenue Manager to figure out a way to measure this efficiently, so that you can track your property’s hits and misses. Such KPIs extend beyond market share indices and focus mainly on profitability. For instance, you have to gauge lost occupancy share and average RevPAR share to ensure that the revenue flow-through goes up significantly.Now it’s time that you ask yourself a few questions:In case the exercise seemed confusing, it’s high time that you get some expert advice about even better ways to use BI tools for your hotel. # 2. Automation… more Automation… and still more Automation!Achieving a perfect 2-way connectivity between your hotel’s PMS and distribution channels, with no parity issues seamlessly, is impossible without automation.Automation will help you attain a single-image view of your hotel’s entire inventory. But, alongside such an automated distribution, as a RM you have to incorporate intelligent decision trees on the basis of the following:Such an interlinked matrix will provide you a sophisticated view!# 3. With a new outlook comes new insights!As a hotel, you should be able to track web rates of your comp-set as well as all GDS bookings. Your revenue management strategy should utilize this data to figure out the competitor’s revenue management strategy!Never forget that your prospective guests are super active, for they have bumped into fresh avenues such as:Overwhelming, isn’t it? Well such promotions are now integral to the entire product mix available on major OTAs. They work closely with supplier partners to roll out promotions as well as drive bookings.As a visionary RM, you need to track all such promotions and offers, as these are warning signs of possible impact on your hotel’s transient demand.# 4. ROI lies at the core of it all!You have to stay prepared in advance for all monthly or quarterly review meetings associated with distribution partners. For this, you need to gather data about their productivity and performance with respect to your hotel.To create a pre-meeting dashboards, you can depend on the following:This analysis will help you develop a better insight about the productively and ROI received from each of your channel partners. And will also help you decide your future engagement level with them. # 5. Use data to come up with decisionsHotels generally utilize competitive intelligence tools to understand the market better.  Sometimes, hoteliers take all the available data, which can be an overwhelming exercise for the RM.The data fed into your revenue management system or a BI tool will basically use your product’s visualization capabilities. The thumb rule of data analytics is – “Garbage in – Garbage out”!And remember that decision making can be unproductive with huge volumes of obsolete data. So as an RM, you have to analyze active booking windows on just the major channels and create buckets, to highlight major booking periods.Since every channel attracts a different segment of business, booking patterns for such segments need not be the same.Also, as an SRM you can track your competition on every channel bucket followed by its active booking window. This might help you identify certain key data points that can drive results for your hotel.Thus as a smart revenue manager, you cannot afford to ignore Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). The need of the hour is that you realized that the beginning of new age methods is your key to unearth the world of predictive, big data driven and revenue management strategies!Stay connected for more insights on the revenue management mantras in Part II of this blog.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2701"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-BUTTON-6-April-03.png"" alt=""hotel-revenue-optimisation-tool"" width=""523"" height=""146"" />+",https://rategain.com/blog/5-things-about-hotel-revenue-management-your-boss-wants-to-know-part-i/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Increase-Sales-Revenue-66983953-765x382-764x382-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Increase-Sales-Revenue-66983953-765x382-764x382-1.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-BUTTON-6-April-03.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Revenue Management,,,,,,,0
65632961a3f6fc78b8eba314,-181723174,"Hotels, Improve your Online Distribution Strategy with Six Simple Tips","July 12, 2016","Hotels have to be spot-on with their online distribution strategy because how the guest has made his booking can make a big difference to a hotel’s bottom line. Hoteliers have to focus on their operating efficiency via appropriate rate distribution management. The idea is to work out a channel mix to optimize maximum output with maximum profit. The focus is on cutting down distribution costs and improving the top line revenues by strengthening their marketing and distribution reach. The new fashions that are evolving, increased role of Channel Management Solution is a prominent factor for today’s revenue manager to succeed.“Defining what inventory to sell where and at what price has become a critical step in running a profitable hotel business”The emergence of Google and new startups coupled with the growth of mobile platform means hotels couldn’t be complacent in 2016 by simply relying on growth from existing partners. Instead, they have to plan for the future and start counting on relatively new distribution options. Those who did so are more likely to witness increased revenue flowing in and respond better to market needs in the coming years.Table of ContentsListed below are a few tips for hoteliers to improve their online Hotel Channel Distribution:1. Keep your target guest in mind, while designing your hotel channel distribution strategyHotels should focus on supporting channels based on the customer profile they want to target, e.g. Are you targeting the “price conscious” category, or you are looking to tap the customers looking for “best value” or some other category apart from these. Accordingly, design your strategy and budget for inventory distribution.2. Work in partnership with your OTAsDistribution through OTAs is usually the least profitable channel, but you cannot ignore the fact that it has great efficacy when it comes to reaching out to brand agnostic customers. Additionally, don’t overlook to quantify the ‘billboard’ effect by getting listed on third-party distributors’ sites. Keep your General Manager, Revenue Manager and other staff updated about new channels and strategies, as hotels can have more leverage if they are striving for the same goals and objectives.3. Be watchful of mobile apps and social mediaMobile can now be clearly called the mainstream platform for booking, and social media is also picking up as a major distribution methodology.Mobile App is gaining ground across the travel & hospitality space, driven by the stair step effect created by better smart mobile devices and enhanced mobile apps/mobile sites.A big plus for travel is the increased ease of researching and booking on the go, which is needed given how often travel plans change on the fly. In this respect, hotels can adapt how some of the successful travel intermediaries are performing and operating.As an e.g., consider the instance of Kayak’s mobile apps. It has been downloaded over 20 million times. Kayak’s 3Q app downloads and queries increased at a tremendous pace and its revenue per 1,000 mobile queries is $62, growing by 63% over Q3 last year. “For Kayak specifically, the growth rate is largely a function of a smaller baseline and that kind of growth is unsustainable long-term.  Mobile’s currently lower RPM is likely to grow as consumers get more comfortable with a buying a broader range of travel on mobile devices,” says Lincoln Merrihew, managing director of Automotive and Travel at Compete4. Last Minute deals on Mobile PlatformMany hotels are comfortable with offering last minute exclusive deals to third-party mobile platforms, but certain revenue management and distribution officials believe such practice can weaken the value proposition of the brand and their brand website, and other partner channels too.Hotels need to take a call whether this can be a workable strategy. And if they decide to take a dive, then they would need to find ways to safeguard their brand and price integrity. Hotels need to gauge areas such as cancellations for mobile bookers in order to strengthen their rate and guarantee policies.5. Don’t ignore the role of other channels like Google Hotel Finder & Room KeyHotels can’t ignore the prowess of Google Hotel Finder as a traffic source amongst others like Room Key, etc. Important factors would be keeping a tab on CPC rates on Hotel Finder and how they are faring against Google AdWords keywords, plus how the click-to-book ratios are shaping up; what sort of impact the tool is going to have on the reliance of hotels on indirect distribution channels etc.Any online search engine that directs booking traffic back to your own branded website is always advantageous. The value for guests is essentially more choice, much like what OTAs offers.6. Last but not the least clasp innovationHotel companies need to shape up functionalities on their sites or partners with those who understand how customers are likely to book or what gets them going from the scratch for their booking. There has been a dialogue of selling experiences rather than just a room, talks about how does a consumer think and how can technology facilitate this to make their experience better and more convenient. So it entails coming up with an ingeniously designed search interface that lets a consumer get closer to a booking.We hope this culmination of research and tips on distribution practices & landscape, and hotel performance based on the online distribution channel mix would help you define your distribution strategy.

65632964a3f6fc78b8eba316,-1975369144,How to Ensure the Demand Generated is Translated into Increased Revenues?,"July 11, 2016","Global travellers are spending more moolah than ever before, on hotel bookings alone these days. The global hospitality division is all set to observe a record flouting year in 2016. Hotel metrics like occupancy, RevPAR and ADR values are all geared up to break the previous records, as the forecast for the year 2016 is in fine fettle according to the leading hospitality research firm – STR. Another research by Killarney Hotels designates that the global hotel industry revenue might reach $550 billion US dollars by the end of this year.Accordingly, hospitality providers are chalking out plans to convert the demands of their business and leisure customers into substantial dollars, as they are vying for a slice of the traveler’s expenses. This has been compelling hoteliers to restructure demand generation and revenue-spawning strategies, so as to seize as many new clients and retain existing customers too.No wonder that one of the biggest challenges hoteliers face is how to make the transition from being a demand generation-focused organization to becoming a revenue-generating organization. Ideally, any hotelier would want to increase their top line (sales) and decrease expenses (which span across both variables and certain fixed costs), in order to witness an increase in the hotel’s bottom line.Table of ContentsUtilize demand from Inbound marketing to increase your hotel’s top lineNever ever neglect leads from inbound marketing!First of all, let’s discuss about the role of inbound marketing, in generating more revenue from demand.Inbound marketing is much in vogue today, but as marketers we need to be educated about how to get the most out of our inbound leads, who have just scouted on your web pages for reviews or price comparison and show a lesser inclination for any revenue generation engagement, until they have advanced way forward in your sales funnel.“Inbound marketing costs 62% less per lead as compared to outbound marketing.” – Mashable.comAs a consequence, a blueprint is required to capture inbound prospects and crack them into paying customers, generating more revenue for us.Not only this, we also need to develop an inbound marketing process, that is not just efficient and predictable, but also repeatable in future.Create a revenue-generation marketing planWhen a hotel’s occupancy rates and RevPAR rise, it is usually a good indication that the management is performing well.In order to reach this stage, the hotel’s marketing plan for revenue generation should align with the business priorities and goals, as set out in the main revenue generation plan. Based on that target, you decide to set a marketing team, and accordingly set performance goals for the demand waterfall, including:All of them are needed to drive the revenue forward and achieve your revenue quota as a marketer.Faster lead response time leads to better conversion ratesWhen you receive an inquiry on your website, a specific response time needs to be set. This can vary from 5 minutes to an hour, and this surely acts as the magic number. You are more likely to qualify the lead in scenarios where your lead response time is faster.“Responding to leads within an hour generates seven times more conversations” – Harvard Business ReviewMore consistent and better the follow-up on leads, better the conversion of leads into opportunitiesMarketers live and die by whether their leads turn into sales and eventually into revenue.So when you have a qualified lead, make sure you have an assigned team whose sole job is to reach out to leads, overcome objections, ensure they are a fit, and get them connected to sales teams for final closure.They can follow certain lead conversion strategies such as:Focus on Social MediaFrom the above points, it is very clear that social media data and customer review analytics need to be effectively used by hotels in order to optimize distribution and maximize revenue growth. This has become a revolutionary trend.So as a hotelier, you should use your Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts as well as other digital media channels to grab some buzz for your hotel. You could also spread the word by rendering tips about local events, travel bites, discounts and special offers, to attract guests.Improved revenue cycle analyticsAdding another stage between marketing and sales, will help you track conversion rates and other key metrics in a more granular fashion. Which implies that when problems arise, you can easily identify the causes and resolve them faster and with better follow-through than if you bunch together the responsibilities of qualifying and closing leads.Keep database updatedSales Executives are mostly blamed for not updating database and contacts of the leads and prospects in their CRM tool. This exercise becomes much easier with a dedicated database team updating and entering complete information on frequent intervals. This assist the marketing department to get more accurate data to work on and latest information that they can utilise to augment their future lead generation dynamism. Optimised Revenue ManagementTraditional Revenue Management Systems or RMSs revolve around the creation of complicated pricing strategies based on demand forecasting and generation. For the records, a forecast-based pricing approach might miss the opportunity to make best use of long-standing customer values. After all, it emphasizes only on short-term revenue gains!In such competitive times of the hospitality environment, hospitality providers need to optimize their revenue management strategy. They can start out by considering the following:Above points clearly suggest that a powerful RMS also doubles up as a real-time RevPAR and ADR builder. Such a unified platform smartly integrates customer data, demand generation information and forecasting as well as market analytics (e.g., online travel agencies and global distribution systems), along with other data bites like local events and advanced visualization. Such an analytical study helps hoteliers to seamlessly create opportunities for better room pricing, sturdier loyalty programs and operational enhancements.Committing to a better revenue management for revenue generationWe all know that revenue management relies upon your ability to look into both near and distant future, so as to view occupancy demand and making rate decisions. This revolves around measuring reservation booking pace and studying occupancy generators in your area to come up with a smart decision.Hence, it is always good to commit to learn as well as use revenue management. This helps to increase occupancy and average rates, that equates to revenue. Such a central research might require some effort, but the rewards are always great. Only then will the economy slowly improve and solidify your position in the global hospitality marketplace as well as engender rewards in the long run.The human touch enhances lead nurturingLastly, whether or not leads are sales-ready, CRM sales team can nurture relationships with each prospect. You can offer more personalized product and present a solution around a lead’s individual pain points, and cultivate future demand.",https://rategain.com/blog/how-to-ensure-the-demand-generated-is-translated-into-increased-revenues/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotel-revenue-management-system-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotel-revenue-management-system-900x450.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Demand forecasting,price optimization,Revenue Management,,,,,0
65632967a3f6fc78b8eba318,-137751987,"Brexit: The Impact on Travel and Tourism Industry, Now and Later","June 27, 2016","Now that the result of the UK referendum on membership of the EU is known, there is much for the travel industry to consider. The consequences of the decision in favour of Brexit will extend far and wide, not only in the UK but across Europe and the rest of the world.In the short term, the uncertainty and political upheaval have led to volatility in financial markets.The lower value of Sterling will result in higher operating costs for some businesses; fuel and energy will be more expensive, potentially leading to higher air fares. Conversely, costs for travellers coming to the UK will be lower making it a more attractive destination, especially for leisure visitors.While fluctuations in economic conditions are not unusual, especially in the period since 2008, there is set to be an extended period of instability for as long as the future path remains uncertain.In the run-up to the referendum, many companies had indicated that a decision to leave the EU would have negative consequences for their businesses and for the economy of the UK.It is too soon to be certain how the reality of Brexit will play out. The negotiation of the exit terms and the nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU’s single market will take many months or even years to complete. In the meantime, businesses must continue to plan for the future and look to take advantage of the new opportunities that will arise.For airlines based in the UK, a major consideration will be their access to the EU’s single aviation market which has enabled budget operators such as Ryanair and EasyJet to flourish. The lucrative US to London routes may also see changes if a post-Brexit UK is no longer participating in the US-EU open skies agreement.For hoteliers, there are concerns over the impact that Brexit may have on key operational indicators such as RevPAR. According to STR Global, the moving average of RevPAR for London hotels has increased for 30 consecutive months. Recently the rate of growth has been slowing as uncertainty has taken hold.Hoteliers are also considering the impact on their plans for expansion and investment which may have been made on the assumption that the UK would still be part of the EU.Here again, it is important to differentiate between the short-term and long-term view. Hotels in London with a significant proportion of corporate business will inevitably be affected if large multi-national corporations based in the city decide to relocate their operations elsewhere in the EU.Over time, new conditions will prevail in the UK. There may be a more positive outcome for hotels as a result of more rapid growth in the economy.In the short term, overall inbound travel to the UK remains the focus. UK visitor numbers grew by 5%* in the period to April 2016; hotels will be waiting for the latest figures to see if the vote for Brexit has affected the positive trend.*Data source: VisitBritain.org",https://rategain.com/blog/brexit-the-impact-on-travel-and-tourism-industry-now-and-later/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brexit-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brexit-900x450.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,Hospitality trends,Revenue Management,,,,,,0

If you do not have the resources to dedicate one person at your hotel to manage this, involve everybody to ensure this critical demand generator is not being ignored.About Author:<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""wp-image-2753 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg"" alt=""effective-ways-to-measure-demand"" width=""656"" height=""263"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-ways-to-measure-generate-demand-part-iv/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Online-Guest-Reviews-hotels-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Online-Guest-Reviews-hotels-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,hotel channel manager,Online reputation management,Rate shopping,,,,,0
65632971a3f6fc78b8eba31e,-1932463214,Effective Ways to Measure & Generate Demand - Part II,"June 15, 2016","Last week in Part I of the Effective Ways to Measure & Generate Demand, we discussed the first 2 steps to creating an efficient, effective and long-term demand generation strategy which were;In part II of this series, we will discuss demand generation within the OTA market segment and how you can position your hotel to become a market leader in this space.Traditional OTAs like Booking.com, Expedia, HRS, Agoda, etc. Obviously, the first 2 OTAs mentioned on the list are the overwhelming producers; however do not overlook other small OTAs to generate additional business. Ensure you have a reliable channel manager that connects to a large variety of OTAs. Some OTA partners may only contribute a handful of reservations per month so you do the math. Take for example a hotel that works with 6 smaller OTAs that produce on average 8 room nights per month. That is an additional 576 room nights annually. This also helps to better spread your production amongst OTAs. As the old phrase goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”Another way to diversify OTA business and generate more demand is to look into your feeder markets. Are there local OTAs in those markets that can drive incremental business for your hotel? Have a look at your competitor hotels via MetaSearch sites and find out if they are working with any OTAs that you have not yet added and be sure to add them. If you do not have a solid insight on your feeder markets, you might be surprised to see what you find. Be sure that you review this on a monthly basis as you will find seasonality in your feeder markets.When working with OTAs to generate demand, carefully consider targeted promotions. Some OTAs have the ability to push promotions to specific markets/clients so be sure that you understand all of your options.Take for example a hotel located in Europe. January is typically very low season for most hotels in Europe but this is summer in South America. Therefore guests from this market would be taking their annual holidays. Speak with your market managers to see the options available for pushing out targeted promotions during your hotel’s low season. Be sure that you do this enough in advance to effect the target booking window.Although OTAs come at a cost, these are experts in marketing and do have powerful tools to help your hotel. Ensure that you do a proper displacement analysis before running promotions to be smart about increasing your incremental revenue.Lastly, look outside the obvious. During my days of Revenue Management for Independent Hotels, I used Airbnb as a channel for my hotels and it worked. Hotels are increasingly worried about the rise of this channel and for good cause. However if you can’t beat them, join them. Think about the traditional Airbnb guest, what are they looking for? Often larger rooms like Triple or Family rooms which traditionally was more difficult to sell in city center hotels during the weekdays. On top of that, stays for Airbnb guests tended to be much longer than the traditional OTA, normally 4+ nights. So by adding this channel, I was able to further diversify my distribution, fill lower demand rooms, save on cost (Airbnb is low commission) and also add incremental revenue.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2643"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-BUTTON-03.png"" alt=""%image_alt%"" width=""496"" height=""138"" />About Author:<img decoding=""async"" class=""size-full wp-image-2753 aligncenter"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg"" alt=""effective-ways-to-measure-demand"" width=""1016"" height=""408"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-ways-to-measure-demand-part-ii/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotel-demand-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotel-demand-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-BUTTON-03.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,,,hotel channel manager,Rate shopping,,,,,,0
65632973a3f6fc78b8eba320,1811669457,Effective Ways to Measure & Generate Demand – Part III,"June 15, 2016","Over the last 2 weeks of the blog series Effective Ways to Measure & Generate Demand, we discussed the first steps in creating an efficient, effective and long-term demand generation strategy as well as demand generation within the OTA segment.In part III of this series, we will discuss demand generation within the Online discount Segment; Flash Sales/Private Sales.One great way to generate more demand and gain occupancy, especially during the low season is through Flash Sales or Private Sales. These agencies work by selling distressed inventory with deep discounts. Some of the more popular sites for these types of sales are:There are also several of these sites specific to each country/region, so do your research to find out which ones could help generate business for your destination, based on your top feeder markets (which we discussed in last week’s blog).The first step in working with Private Sale sites is to understand how these types of partners work. Some first questions to ask when you get in contact with the potential partner are as follows: (my generic answers are also next to each question).What is the stay window I must provide? Is that limited to days of week? Most require 90 days but can be up to 6 months or more. Because these sites are focused more towards leisure travellers they require availability for weekend stays (Friday, Saturday/Sunday); however, if you have needs dates that fall on weekdays as well you can certainly include those days.How long does the sale last? This depends upon each individual partner but it can be as short as 7 days and as long as 30 days.What is the commission % that you charge for each booking? Again this depends on each partner. The commission can be as low as 15% and up to 25%. My experience that the average is around 20-22%. It is highly advisable that you try and negotiate the best commission from each partner.Is there a minimum discount required? Again this depends on each partner however the minimum discount is usually 30% and that applies to the room rate and F&B included in your offer.What is the Daily allotment required? This depends on each partner and obviously this would vary depending on the size of your hotel and specific needs. Often, this can be determined on a daily basis. Be sure that you do not overcommit yourself to allotments that can displace other business. You often have the opportunity to add more allotments during the sale.What value adds are suggested? Typical value adds that can make your offer more attractive are: breakfast included, upgrade included, late check out/early check in, welcome drink included, free parking, discounts on F&B or Spa.Do I need to offer a fixed price for this offer or can I offer daily pricing? This depends on the partner. Most prefer fixed pricing; however if you ask, daily pricing is an option if you would like.Can I include blackout dates? Yes, most partners allow for blackout dates, you will be limited to the number that you can offer but you do have the ability to protect your high demand dates.Once you have the above information, you can start to draft your offer. A few things to keep in mind when creating the offer. Determine your stay window. For example if you would like to impact the summer season, start your sale in May/June and offer weekends only and once your slower season starts (from July 1 for example) you can start to offer all days of week through the typical summer months. Also remember if you would like to work with 2-3 different partners, you must plan each sale so that they do not overlap each other. I suggest creating a planning calendar on a yearly basis so you know in advance exactly when you want to launch your sale(s) throughout the year.The next step is to determine the offer. This step requires careful consideration. Keep in mind that typically the discount must be based off the room value and F&B value. The other value adds are meant to be enhancements to make the offer more attractive. Also keep in mind that you need to price the offer off your lowest available offer that can be found online. You must also determine the minimum room revenue that you will accept, minus commission and other costs, and make sure you work within this number.Remember, sales like this are meant to sell distressed inventory and add occupancy during your need periods. You many want to consider offering a two-nights offer that gives a bit further discount but would attract customers to stay longer. Finally, make sure that your staff is aware of the offers that are out there in the market and if a guest calls the hotel to book direct, make this offer available. You could save on commission and create direct contact with the guest. About Author:<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""wp-image-2753 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg"" alt=""effective-ways-to-measure-demand"" width=""593"" height=""238"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-ways-to-measure-generate-demand-part-iii/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Way-connection-or-Common-Pool-Inventory-963x481.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Way-connection-or-Common-Pool-Inventory-963x481.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,hotel channel manager,Rate shopping,,,,,,0
65632976a3f6fc78b8eba322,2053443078,Effective Ways to Measure and Generate Demand - Part I,"May 17, 2016","Measuring and generating demand is always a question that prospective clients ask as it’s certainly a challenge many hoteliers face. In order to be successful, hotels must set up an efficient, effective and long-term demand generation strategy. In this blog series, we will take you through those steps from the most obvious to the less obvious.The first step in understanding demand generation is to fully understand your product, customer(s) and value proposition. Take for example a 4-Star Hotel located in city center that has a good mix of both business and leisure travellers. Think about the target customers or target market segments and how you can create a unique value proposition to appeal to both.For the typical business travellers, following are a few examples of value propositions that they’re looking for:On the other hand, a typical leisure guest may tend to look for the values such as:Most leisure travellers are more price sensitive. Once you have nailed down your target product, customer(s) and value proposition the second step to creating an efficient, effective and long-term demand generation strategy is pricing.An important part of correct pricing is tracking what your competitors and the market are doing. In order to correctly do this, you must invest in a reliable rate shopping tool that can help you to track your competitors pricing on a daily basis as well as provide an overview of the different rates & room types they are offering, when and how often they are changing rates, when they are sold out (market compression) as well as many other useful data analytics features and tools.Once you have some intelligence on what the market is doing in terms of pricing then it’s time to create different pricing options that would appeal to the different types of customers you have identified as your target clients. The typical business guest may be willing to pay a bit more given they have more flexibility in the cancellations, whereas the typical leisure traveller may be looking for that deal so, paying less in advance with a no cancellation policy could be an attractive offer.Try and create multiple price points and offers with the correct restrictions to appeal to a large variety of customers. Make sure you are clear with your price offering and on any given stay date, try not to have too many offers that could confuse but enough to attract different types of guests.Lastly, be sure to review your offers and pricing strategies on a seasonal basis and make changes as necessary to market demands.About Author:<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""wp-image-2753 alignleft"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg"" alt=""blog-Karen"" width=""750"" height=""301"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/effective-ways-to-measure-and-generate-demand-part-i/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rate-intelligence-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rate-intelligence-900x450.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-Karen.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,hotel channel manager,Rate shopping,,,,,,0
65632979a3f6fc78b8eba324,-650893256,8 Top Tips to Choose the Right Hotel Channel Manager,"May 3, 2016","In today’s dynamic and competitive marketplace, almost all hotels are resorting to channel management to manage room rates and availability across OTAs and maximize revenue. Numerous channel managers are mushrooming, with each one of them claiming a unique functionality and technology. This makes the selection of an efficient channel manager not only difficult but confusing too.Table of Contents8 top tips to choose the most optimal channel management technology for your hotel’s distribution strategy.1. Advanced user interfaceHotels manage huge volumes of data across multiple channels. Opt for a channel manager that can enable daily tasks – yield management, rate distribution, monitoring, reservations tracking or delivery of the reservation data into PMS – from a single interface for a streamlined administration.2. OTA contract facilitationA channel manager may support numerous OTAs in a hotel’s source market, however, it is of no use if the hotel does not distribute on those channels. It must act as a liaison between an OTA and the hotel for contracting purposes to widen the hotel’s reach and enhance visibility on new channels.3. Cloud-based channel managementA cloud based channel management offers hotels to remain connected with prospective guests and access the data from anywhere, anytime. Indeed, such systems have an in-built redundancy that keeps the back-up ready and data running even during a server break down.4. Connected channels and upgradationA channel manager must support a wide array of channels in a hotel’s source market, but shouldn’t be restricted to online channels. Failure to track offline bookings or manage direct bookings can be detrimental for the hotel’s overall revenue strategy. Get a channel manager that can enhance control over both distributed prices and availability across distribution points. Also, ask for:– Number of channels that can be connected– Ease of connecting an unavailable channel5. Customisation according to channelNo OTA works similarly; some offer rates inclusive of tax while others keep it separate. Accordingly, their extranets also accept rates in a similar fashion. A channel manager should allow a user to enter rates in a single format and be smart enough to do relevant calculations followed by passing it on apt extranets.6. Automated Inventory ManagementManaging individual inventory allocation is definitely a hassle! A smart channel manager allows allocating inventory to a common pool rather than individual OTAs, hence saving time and effort involved in managing rate parity. It also supports creation of promotions and pushing them directly to the extranets.7. Productivity AnalyticsAn efficient channel manager offers hotels deep insights and analytics on channel partners’ performance to help them optimize their revenue management strategy.8. Training & supportYour best bet will also be the one that comes along with dedicated support, offering complete guidance to how to make the most of it.<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2653"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ChannelTA-BUTTON-2-01-03-03.png"" alt=""ChannelTA BUTTON-2-01-03-03"" width=""569"" height=""122"" />",https://rategain.com/blog/8-top-tips-to-choose-the-right-hotel-channel-manager/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Channel-Management-Top-Tips-to-Choose-the-Right-Hotel-Channel-Manager.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Channel-Management-Top-Tips-to-Choose-the-Right-Hotel-Channel-Manager.webp,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ChannelTA-BUTTON-2-01-03-03.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,,,,,,0

65632988a3f6fc78b8eba32e,882434776,Did You Know? It’s critical to Push Rates along with Occupancy,"February 19, 2016","While a lot of hotels strive to achieve a fine balance on what strategy to apply in their business strategy, Push Occupancy or Strive for higher rates; it is extremely critical to identify high-demand periods in advance as those are the dates when hotels MUST push rates as well as occupancies.All markets experience seasonal fluctuations in their business patterns and this seasonality clubbed with perishability aspect makes revenue management in hotels a crucial exercise, and thus not identifying and then maximizing on high demand date in future is suicidal for hotels. While hotels continue to push for “Heads in Beds”, it is that extra dollar in RevPAR which they really want as that is what helps in the bottom-line.There are many ways to maximize but it’s generally a combination of many techniques that can get the work done. Some of the easiest techniques are:a) Plan your room allocation and ensure that there is an opportunity for hotels in terms of room availability to yield and thus it is essential to have rooms of higher category to be yielded by transient demand on such dates.b) Having made this point it’s crucial that inventory management discourages upgrades by overbooking.c) Close out Discounts and ensure that you have increased prices of all room/rate type combination.d) Ensure that there are no blockages in distribution pipeline and the high priced room/rate combinations are available for sale. At the same time there are enough levers in place to flow the demand in low demand dates as well.e) Identify your business mix and try to keep low priced business at minimum possible.

6563298aa3f6fc78b8eba330,956273247,Hotel Demand Forecasting: Top 3 Ways Hoteliers Can Leverage this Strategic Management Tool,"February 12, 2016","Human minds are inherently prone to biases. Isn’t it? In hotel revenue management, biases can be your worst nightmares since these can result in imprecise conclusions. And, inaccurate conclusions often equal to missed revenue opportunities.Look, either you have a crystal ball that empowers you to know how much will be the average length of stay for varied rate categories in your hotel or what will be the occupancy percentage for “x” number of room nights and many more. Does that imply you’ve got to sit back and wait for the results to pan out? Of course not!That’s why room demand forecasting is so critical for effective planning and quick decision making. In fact, an improvement of 10% in forecasting accuracy can result in a surge of 1.5% to 3% in revenue generated from a revenue management system.And before you keep reading: why you need room demand forecasting? Check out this blog here.In this post, let’s discover how you can improve your hotel demand forecast approach and maximize your hotel’s profitability manifold with better pricing.You already know it – profit maximization is your key KPI as a revenue manager, while that includes optimum room pricing (that’s influenced by demand forecasting) and also cost reduction.The more accurate and clear demand picture you have, the better you can strategize your staffing, front desk, housekeeping, marketing, operations, and pricing. This also helps you resurrect your revenue management strategy based on projected upcoming demand.Let’s face it – demand forecasting is a complex discipline.But you can master it with a smart approach that ultimately helps you understand how to price your hotel rooms optimally to maximize your revenues. Put, this strategic management tool helps you become proactive in managing your inventory and prices smartly to boost your hotel’s profitability.Table of Contents1. Big Data, Big Revenue OpportunitiesIt’s in 2022.Yet, many hotel industry players across the world still rely on their guesswork and instincts for forecasting.However, some smart revenue managers embracing technology strategize using information from tools with scientific algorithms that employ various statistical models like exponential smoothing, moving average, etc.PMS, home to mountains of historical as well as future data, was traditionally used to understand the scope of upcoming demand across different room categories, length of stays, guest segments, and other data points such as booking pace, weather, etc.Hoteliers used to turn to the historical booking information available, recreate past booking curves, and compare the pace of bookings. However, those pricing decisions were not reliable.Fortunately, with more and more technology adoption, Big Data has made inroads into the fabric of the hotel industry and emerged as a game-changer for hoteliers. It’s here to stay and has brought about a paradigm shift (look ahead, not back!) in the hotel demand forecasting been done so far.Today a lot has changed or better to say, more evolved– customer segments, customer behavior, etc. We have piles of competitor pricing information available too. Pro Tip: Not all data is the right data. So beware!Then we have other data sets that can be taken into consideration while taking pricing decisions:All these factors and wealth of information can help a modern hotelier understand market demand much better and build an accurate demand forecasting picture well in advance to make profitable rate adjustments and sell more inventory at the best possible rates.­Hotel Pricing Strategy Before Covid 19Increased volatility due to COVID-19 has made it difficult for revenue managers & marketing teams to plan their pricing, distribution & marketing optimization strategies.Traditionally, they have relied on sources that leverage lagging indicators (like occupancy, booking pace, seasonality etc.) to forecast demand – factors that in current times have limited relevance.Pre-Covid 19, hoteliers relied on external research bodies and internal searches/booking data to forecast pricing and demand patterns.Both these mediums used to rely heavily on lagging indicators.What has changed the Post-Covid19 Hotel pricing strategy? Along with Pandemic came the problem of predicting future and understanding future market trends.Covid 19 world has changed everything and now it’s imperative to take into consideration factors impacting the demand in your city.It’s challenging to predict future demand using historical data because of uncertain and volatile situations, thus forward-looking indicators become relevant to understand the future demand trends.To understand future demand, it is imperative to increase accuracy and forecast by using certain macro and high-level intel relating to:Hence, it is suggested to holistically look into the above-mentioned demand indicators to provide a forecast, as well as also gives insights on how the customer behavior pattern is evolving and impacting the below –Granular, Accurate & Hyperlocal demand information is the need of the hour to plan the most optimal post-Covid 19 pricing strategy.It’s important in today’s world to understand the pace and pick up at destination level and just not take decisions basis the property historical data or competition data.2. Track Web Shopping BehaviorTo be able to build optimal price points, a hotel needs to forecast unconstrained demand. And for that, it’s imperative to look at the hotel’s denials and regrets.And thus, website data is a crucial source for these. If you wish to determine the popularity score for your hotel on a given day, look at your hotel’s website traffic.The valuable web insights can help you get a clearer picture of your current and upcoming true unconstrained demand by unraveling details such as your website visits that reflect the frequency of last-minute arrivals.You will also be able to see as to how many website visitors are you attracting to your hotel’s website at a certain time on a specific day.If you can analyze the website visitors’ data vs. future date bookings, you can build an accurate future demand picture. You can also determine the price sensitivity of your customers by assessing the prices at which consumers are making bookings and their site abandonment rate (due to rate controls or inventory limitations).But it’s Not as Easy as it looks!You must be able to capture the accurate difference between denials and regrets, which is tough.Some hotels use CRS data to track this. The Internet has also empowered hoteliers like you to collate the bulk of consumer shopping data. You can easily find out now as to how many bookers landed up on your website but did not finish the booking.This customer lost data reflects on the latent demand but only if you have a clear picture of denials and regrets as mentioned above too.However, you can fall prey to miscalculating the latent demand if you use multiple distribution channels as again for every channel you need to clearly distinguish between denials and regrets.As a revenue manager, you can utilize this data to determine the conversion rates and plan the roadmap to recover from the site abandonment.3. Competitive Intelligence and Competitor Pricing Besides the deep analysis of your hotel’s web shopping data, competitive intelligence and competitor pricing can also help you make accurate demand forecasts.You must identify a competitive set (similar to your property size, consumer segment, and comparable pricing model) that you need to set your eyes on.Then, glean their demand by fetching and analyzing their room rates using some price intelligence tools across various distribution channels, GDS and their brand websites.If your competitor makes any change(s) to their price, it can impact your demand since it might be the strategy of your competitor to acquire your customers.Thus, competitor pricing can influence price-sensitive consumers. It can also have an indirect impact on your demand if you (as a revenue manager) make rate adjustments to combat the price challenge thrown by your competitors.ConclusionHotel revenue management has emerged as an important discipline that entails ever-changing consumer behaviors, new age channels, varied pricing models, lean booking windows, and many more aspects. Amidst all this, accurate demand forecasting is the jumping pad to maximizing your revenue and hotel profitability.",https://rategain.com/blog/hotel-demand-forecasting-top-3-ways-hoteliers-can-leverage-this-strategic-management-tool/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/room-forecasting-1216x608.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/room-forecasting-1216x608.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Demand forecasting,hotel demand forecasting,hotel dynamic pricing,,,,,0

65632990a3f6fc78b8eba334,224017665,Zika virus outbreak:  Is tourism industry in Central and South America on risk?,"February 8, 2016","It’s growing and getting stronger. This Zika virus news capsule is not easy for the travel and tourism industry professionals to swallow. As the mosquito-borne Zika virus enters into the United States, there’s a growing anxiety in the tourism industry.Further, a warning from the WHO that the Zika virus is “spreading explosively” and that it’s now an international ‘public health emergency’ has global implications. Vacationers are now rethinking their travel plans, especially to most affected countries and territories that include Caribbean tourist places like Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and areas in Latin American countries like Mexico, Brazil and Panama.Though the Zika virus isn’t new and until last year, most outbreaks of this disease had been mild. However, triggered by El Niño-inflicted heavy rains and flooding, this mosquito-borne transmitted disease has now taken a lethal form and impacted the above mentioned regions. The threat is bigger with Zika believed to be linked to a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.Amid rising concern over the Zika virus outbreak sweeping Latin America and probability that it could spread much farther, the travel industry has now started to react. Some travel companies like KK Travels Worldwide (that books honeymoon and babymoon trips) have already started feeling the brunt of the outbreak with a small number of cancellations every day. A few of them have even offered pregnant travelers with the option to postpone their booked trips, though any mass cancellations haven’t been reported as yet.More so, this threat is overshadowing the Rio de Janeiro Olympics too. The organizers and their medical teams are urging athletes to join the Olympic games and giving assurances that only pregnant women (and not athletes) are at risk and that the potential threat seems like a distant one. The organizing committee is also planning to trim their other expenses and fund special initiatives to kill mosquitoes.American Airlines have even offered pregnant travelers and their attendants the option to request a refund for canceled flights provided they produce their doctor’s prescription and note for the same.JetBlue has offered refund or rebooking to customers, who’re skeptical about traveling to Zika-impacted regions. Even Virgin America has announced travelers with plans to fly to any of the airline’s Mexico destinations can get a refund or change their flight free of cost.The sector most at risk in the affected region is the cruise ship business that witnessed 24.5 million cruise ship arrivals in the 30 territories of the Caribbean in 2014. The prime target audience for this business are the honeymooners and young couples (who may get pregnant while holidaying) – who’re believed to be most at risk.However, there is another group of believers/companies in the tourism sector such as Dover Beach Hotel on the Caribbean island of Barbados that seem unfazed by the Zika outbreak though they’re taking all preventive measures. They’re not bothered with the current travel advisories since they are experiencing one of the busiest tourist seasons in recent years with 100% occupancy.Dover Beach Hotel owners are joined by other hotel owners and managers in the Caribbean who believe that the business is currently in good shape though the situation may change fast if the outbreak picks up the pace and the travelers fright traveling to the vacation destinations in the Caribbean region that sees tourism as its biggest driver of revenue. Some airlines and hotel chains find it too early to announce any dip in their bookings.What should you do in this hour of crisis?As a smart hotelier, you have to develop a two-pronged strategy that helps you: As a responsible travel/ tourism brandA detailed contingency plan (inclusive of the crisis management processes) can help hotels and travel companies analyze the intensity of the situation and determine what can be done about this disease threat in their properties or for their businesses for minimal casualties.For example, Hotel chain Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is coordinating with local health authorities and following Centers for Disease Control (CDC) prevention recommendations.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd and rival Carnival Corp have offered expectant mothers covered by the CDC advisories to defer cruises to a future date or choose an itinerary outside the impacted countries.Some hotels (such as Cobblers Cove Hotel in Barbados) are leaving no stones unturned in taking precautionary measures such as anti-mosquito spraying every three weeks to combat the threat. The hotel acknowledges the plausible threat but has been appealing to the tourists for not pressing the panic button.Drive better cash flow for your propertyWhile you establish and maintain your responsible travel/tourism brand identity, it’s equally important to see that you don’t miss out on the revenue front for your property. To do so, you can take a couple of measures such as:As much remains unknown about Zika, its spread and effects, let’s hope you as a hotelier do not have to feel the heat of this break and continue to see a spike in your hotel revenues and business growth.",https://rategain.com/blog/zika-virus-outbreak-impact-on-tourism-in-central-and-south-america/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Zika-586x293.png,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Zika-586x293.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Distribution,hotel channel manager,,,,,,0
65632994a3f6fc78b8eba336,863965673,9 Undeniable Advantages of Hotel Room Forecasting,"January 3, 2016","With the shelf life of a single day for a hotel room, hoteliers aim to maximize its value. And, forecasting is the key driver of the pricing management decisions/inventory management decisions. Agree? Any inaccurate forecast(s) can lead to reduced profit margins for your hotel business.If you’re among those hoteliers who have not tried effective hotel room forecasting yet, then you’re missing out on at least 9 advantages to your hotel revenue management approach. What are those 9 benefits? Read on to find out more. 9 Undeniable Benefits of Hotel Room ForecastingA reliable room forecast is critical in the effective execution of a hotel’s marketing strategy. As hoteliers use forecasting mechanisms to plan their promotion offers (period, targeted territories, etc.), the interrelation between room forecasting and marketing strategy is quite obvious. This is a key trigger for the hotel’s Sales and Marketing team to activate sales & marketing initiatives to attempt and create demand, at the same time promotions are introduced for the same effect. On this strategy table, hotels identify the market segment that can be targeted to make up for the drop expected from the other segment.For example for a forecast of low occupancy for an upcoming period, hotels can decide to run a promotion on all online channels to create an incremental demand as well hotel sales team can run customized promotions for their offline customers to fill up the hotel.An accurate forecast of occupancy and room revenue empowers a revenue manager to yield across various channels.For example, if a property is forecasted for a high occupancy owing to high unconstrained demand then the revenue manager can choose to yield and sell on low cost/high rate channels to maximize profits. Hotel Financial Controller needs information on forecasted room revenue for multiple purposes; to understand cash/credit flow for the hotel as that needs to be considered for multiple expenses that will be generated in different departments including rooms.For example for next month hotel revenue manager makes a forecast that Corporate Groups & Corporate FITs will be dominant in occupancies and Transient segment will be below expectations, a financial controller will have to adjust the outflow of cash since most corporate bookings tend to be realized much later than actual check out when payment from these corporate offices hits the hotel’s bank.Also, additional revenue that will be generated from other departments like F&B, Laundry, etc., is proportional to Room occupancy.As discussed, Hotel Financial Controller creates a cash flow forecast (a forecast of cash coming into and going out of business) on this forecast by revenue manager and this forecast is periodically compared with the hotel budget to track deviation. Though hotel rooms might be the biggest contributors to revenue, but there are other revenue-generating departments too which have their forecast dependent on room forecast, for example, room occupancy will help F&B to know how many resident guests are expected at Breakfast and other meals, similar forecast for other departments like Laundry, Mini Bar, etc.The purchase of perishable as well as non-perishable improves by a good forecast. For Example during a low occupancy period, a hotel may decide to cut down its buffet offerings in the coffee shop and thus need to purchase a lot of perishable food items that will not be there.This is base on which hotels plan their course of actions in all areas for the near future, say 3 months, and move accordingly.Maybe not relevant for every forecast but a demand forecast of unconstrained demand might be referred to by hotel management to plan an expansion if needed.For Example, on a regular basis, the unconstrained demand forecast for a hotel is high which may lead the management to a decision to expand the size of the hotel, if possible, and increase its inventory owing to observed regular high unconstrained demand.Room occupancy forecast will also be referred by all departments for their staffing purposes as well as, if needed, for hiring too.For Example; hotels generally encourage their staff to take their annual leaves in the low season of occupancy so that during their high occupancy period they have staff at full strength to ensure smooth operations.Hotels tend to utilize low occupancy forecasted time for periodical maintenance.For example; the annual renovation of rooms and other areas in a hotel is generally carried out when the forecast is for a low occupancy for a long period.A reliable forecast has a direct impact on the bottom line. ",https://rategain.com/blog/9-undeniable-advantages-of-hotel-room-forecasting/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/business-ohot-762x381.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/business-ohot-762x381.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,price optimization,Revenue maximization,,,,,,0

65632999a3f6fc78b8eba33a,1476475549,A Revenue Management mistake that you need to avoid today,"October 23, 2015","As a revenue manager, taking a decision on the right price is the most important part of your role.However, for your pricing decision to be as accurate as possible, there is another preceding decision that you need to take correctly.Most revenue managers spend a lot of time calculating optimum prices without dedicating sufficient time to this step. The trouble is, not paying enough attention to this step will invariably lead to incorrect pricing and missed revenue opportunities.What am I talking about?Competitive sets.Every hotelier in the world has a comp set. But here’s the important question…\n\nIs your comp set the correct one?\n\nIn other words, does your comp set an accurate reflection of your true competition?Very often – no. Let’s examine the data.STR helps hoteliers to determine better comp sets by analyzing and grading them. The organization has more than 30,000 comp sets in its US database. Here’s how their grading percentages look…A grade – 21% of hotelsB grade – 46%C grade – 33%Therefore, according to this grading system 79% (46+33) of US hotels have the potential of improving their comp sets. That’s a big number!Nameback percentageThe fact that most comp sets have a huge scope for improvement is supported by another indicator – the nameback percentage. Nameback percentage depicts the percentage of hotels that add a competitor back in turn.For instance, Hotel A adds Hotel B as a competitor, but Hotel B does not add Hotel A as a competitor too.Very often, this has two implications…The national nameback percentage in the US is only 48%! This is another indicator that most hotels need to have better comp sets.What are hoteliers doing incorrectly?There are three fundamental mistakes that hoteliers or revenue managers often make when thinking about competitive sets.Your competitive set lies at the very foundation of your pricing research. You need to know exactly who you are going to compare your prices against. In addition, comp sets are also very important for deciding what inclusions you should offer to your customers – breakfast, in-room wi-fi, airport transfers, etc. Finally, comp sets are also important for marketing campaigns – you need to deliver the right message to travelers so that they choose you over your competition.So how do you determine a comp set that is more accurate? Here are a few points to keep in mind for creating better comp sets…Table of Contents1. ListenQuestion: What makes a hotel your competitor?Answer: When a potential guest considers your hotel, as well as that hotel for the purpose of a specific stay, then that hotel becomes a competitor.The point is that each of your prospects is creating his/her own comp set while picking a hotel. Therefore, your search for a better comp set has to begin with the customer.If you listen to your guests, you will be able to see recurring patterns and trends about who they are comparing your hotel to. Try to gather information about your guests’ preferences from various sources especially social media and review sites. These platforms are a gold mine of information about what your guests are thinking about your hotel, who they are comparing you against, and what factors they are taking into consideration when making their choices.This brings us to the second point – factors.2. Consider the right factorsIn most cases the following factors should be taken into consideration:Room rates\n\nRoom rates is possibly the first thing that your guests will take into account while beginning their search.Location and Proximity\n\nFor busy business travelers location is often the most important criteria.Star rating\n\nHotels belonging to the same star rating. Sometimes, hotels a star above and below might also be considered, if their price points are not too far apart and they are located close by.Brand positioning\n\nIn terms of the experience it offers and the clientele it caters to. A resort would have a different brand positioning than a business hotel.There are also other factors like size of the hotel, chains vs boutique hotels, etc.Which factors are the most important – star rating? Location?Maybe, or perhaps not! After all, your factors should depend on what your guests and prospects consider to be the most important factors. Listening to your customers will give you a better idea of the weightage of each factor in your calculations.3. Have multiple comp setsUsually, upper-tier hotels have more than a single comp set. Taking luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the U.S. into account, 16% have three or more sets while 36% have two sets. Of all hotels in the U.S., 91% have a single comp set.However, even if your hotel does not fall into the upper-tier categories, you might want to explore having more than one comp set.You hotel probably caters to different customer segments. A customer who belongs to Segment A would consider and choose your hotel from reasons that are different to a Segment B customer. Having different comp sets allows you to maximize your revenues from different segments – such as group vs transient or business vs leisure.Similarly there are other purposes for having multiple comp sets. Here are a few types of comp sets you can consider:Seasonal\n\nYou might compete with a very different group of hotels in a different season, hotels which might be quite far off from where you are located. Rather than try to take on the difficult task of incorporate that seasonal divergence in a single comp set, why not have a different set altogether?Local\n\nYou can have a comp set which focuses primarily on location.Niche\n\nThis set is based on the similarity of the offering and ignores geography. Comp sets for ski resorts is an example.Aspirational\n\nIf you are working towards rebranding your hotel’s image, renovating it or gearing up for any kind of change, you would need to consider a comp set which reflects that new offering.4. Continuous ImprovementA year back, the sharing economy was not considered to be a serious competition to hotels as it is now. The world is changing at an extremely rapid pace, driven by technology and changing customer tastes and perceptions.If the pace of change is so rapid, why should comp sets remain static?The comp set which was looking perfect yesterday might be completely skewed in a few months time. Besides, no comp set is perfect and Revenue Managers need to revisit them every now and then to have a better representation of who their competitors are.A crucial step in pricingComp sets are one of the first steps in arriving at the right price for your hotel rooms. The data clearly indicates that most hotels have a scope to create better sets. Revenue Managers need to try to make the most of this opportunity to arrive at more optimal pricing – pricing that will help them make more revenue every day.",https://rategain.com/blog/a-revenue-management-mistake-that-you-need-to-avoid-today/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/comp-sets-838x419.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/comp-sets-838x419.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Blog,,,Rate shopping,,,,,,,0

This makes London the top-ranked international travel destination for the fifth time in a seven year period. This is 6% more than the 2014 number of 17.8 million visits.PwC’s latest UK hotels forecast, published in September 2015, has quite a few invaluable insights for UK hoteliers.Table of ContentsRevPAR ProjectionsPwC predicts that UK hotels will continue to see further RevPAR growth in 2015 and 2016.Here are the projections for the UK as a whole (PwC August 2015 projections based on STR July 2015 data)And the projections for London are…As you must have noticed, the growth rate in the provinces (outside London) is a lot more than London.Let’s have a look at the comparative projected growth rates for 2015…Therefore, the growth story is now being driven by the provinces. It’s important to note, that the 2016 projected RevPAR for the provinces is still 5% below pre-recession peaks in real terms (adjusted for inflation). However, 2016E London RevPAR is 6% above pre-recession peaks in real terms.We will examine the different factors that are driving this growth in UK and London. Let’s begin by taking a look at how the economy is doing.The UK EconomyGDP growth in the UK is forecasted at 2.6% in 2015, which would be the highest in the G7. In 2016, it’s projected to be 2.4%. Even though growth slowed in the first quarter, ONS data predicts that it will pick up again in Q2. Positive factors that are contributing to the growth are rise in employment, higher earnings growth, growing investments and lower oil prices – which benefit consumers and most UK businesses.Notable negative factors are a rising pound compared to the Dollar and the Euro, which makes overseas trips cheaper.A Positive Travel OutlookDespite the falling Euro, H1 2015 saw over 16.8 million overseas visits to the UK, growing 3% over 2014. London hotels did really well in 2014, reaching a RevPAR growth of 3.4%.The Great Britain Tourism Survey reports that 28.7 million trips were recorded in England between January and April 2015. This is an 18%  year-on-year growth and is the highest number of trips recorded in the period since the first survey was conducted in 2006.Visit Britain forecasts a 2.5% increase in international visits to 35.1 million with a 4.5% increase in expenditure. Overseas business visits continue to grow, Q1 2015 witnessing more than 2 million business visits. This is the first time since 2008 that business visits have reached this milestone.Both corporates and consumers are expected to keep on travelling more in the UK in 2015 and 2016. The number of people taking domestic short breaks is on the rise, as well as a revival in business travel. One notable event is the Rugby World Cup, beginning in September 2015 which is drawing an estimated 450,000 international visitors.Room Supply – Growth and ChallengesDemand continues to outpace supply growth in the UK overall, while oversupply is an issue in some localities. Supply is on the increase and above average growth is expected in 2016.According to PwC, There are now over 38,000 rooms in the UK’s active pipeline, opening from 2015 to 2017.\n\n14,000 rooms are to open in 2015, 16,000 in 2016 and 8,000 in 2017.Net room growth in the London hotel market has seen 23.6% between 2008 and 2014. Leading this growth have been hotels in the four star segment and branded budget hotels. As the demand for branded budget hotels have increased, 50,000 rooms in the independent and the mid-market segment have closed between 2000 and 2014.Competition is clearly heating up. Both business and leisure travellers are increasingly using non-hotel accommodations like serviced apartments and new style hostels. Of course, the phenomenon on most hoteliers’ radar are shared economy spaces like Airbnb, Homeaway and Flipkey.A recent Phocuswright research showed that 9% of travellers in the UK had rented space in a private home or apartment in the past year. PwC research indicates that there 31,000 AirBnB listings available in London and the number is growing. This is clearly a phenomenon that a lot of hoteliers are concerned about.Key thoughts for revenue managersAll the above has various implications for pricing.

656329a0a3f6fc78b8eba33e,1211373962,How to improve your hotel's online reputation using a 100 year old mathematics principle,"July 16, 2015","According to a PhocusWright study from December 2013, 77% of travellers ‘usually or always reference reviews before choosing a hotel.’ The same study also reveals that 53% of travellers wont ‘commit to booking until they read reviews’, and 80% of travellers ‘read at least 6-12 reviews before booking a hotel’.In fact, according to a recent study, reviews have now become more important than ratings from traditional sources like Forbes and AAA. According to MMGY Global’s ‘2015 Portrait of American Travelers’, 53% of the traveler segment earning an household income over $150,000 a year, now trust review sites more than these traditional rating standards.Table of ContentsReviews and Ratings are CriticalAs a hotelier, you know that reviews and ratings are critical to your success. You are always thinking about how you can improve your hotel’s online reputation. You understand that it’s important to keep improving your service levels.There are dozens of potential areas that you might need to address. Some reviews might contain a photo of a chipped corner of a bathtub, someone might not have be happy with the amount of natural lighting their room had, while others might not be satisfied with the food.The question is, where do you begin? Which areas do you address first?Enter a 100 Year Old Mathematical PrincipleThat’s where the Pareto principle comes in. The Pareto principle, named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, is a concept that can deliver tremendous gains in a business with comparatively little effort. The principle states that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes, or rather, 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.In 1906, Vilfredo Pareto observed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. What’s really interesting is that this 80/20 distribution can be observed across various areas of natural phenomenon, life and business. For example, in a B2B business 80% of revenue comes from 20% of customers;  80% of complaints comes from 20% of customers.How can you apply the Pareto Principle to improve your reviews and ratings scores?You have limited resources at your disposal for managing your hotel. Its’s hardly possible for you to address every single area that your guests have a problem with. However, you can use the Pareto Principle to focus on those issues that matter most.How do you go about identifying those areas?Use Performance by Category<img decoding=""async"" fetchpriority=""high"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2454"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IQA1-e.jpg"" alt=""IQA1 e"" width=""495"" height=""321"" />A simple way to begin is by using BrandGain’s Performance by Category Metrics.You can use the ‘Positive Review Share’, which helps you analyze your hotel performance against your competitors on the basis of positive review share received for selected categories.You can also use the Negative Review Share, which helps you analyze your hotel performance against your competitors based on the negative review share received for selected categories.<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2455"" src=""https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IQA2-e.jpg"" alt=""IQA2 e"" width=""600"" height=""356"" />Another option is to use the Category Score, which helps you analyze your hotel performance against your competitors based on the score received for selected categories.Once you have identified the categories which need your attention, you can drill down deeper into the reviews.You need to look for issues that a large number of people have spoken about as well as those issues which that fewer people have spoken about, but some people feel very strongly about.After going through these categories and reviews, make a list of all the areas that need your attention.Rank these areas in terms of importance.Use this list to finalize the top three areas that need your attention.That’s all there is to it!After this exercise, just go ahead and execute your changes. Keep your eye on the BrandGain dashboards to monitor the effect your initiatives have on your rankings.ConclusionThe key in the pareto principle is to prioritize. Make sure you address those areas which will have the maximum impact on your rating scores. If you can implement this successfully, not only will your scores improve, but you will also be able to command higher room rates.",https://rategain.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-hotels-online-reputation-using-a-100-year-old-mathematical-principle/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pareto-e-700x350.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pareto-e-700x350.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IQA1-e.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IQA2-e.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Blog,,,Guest feedback,Online reputation management,Online reviews management,,,,,0
656329a3a3f6fc78b8eba340,-865399439,RevPar Growth in Europe: The top three cities,"June 4, 2015","It’s a resurgent time in Europe for tourism. According to UNWTO, Europe attracted 22 million more international tourists  in 2014 over the past year. PwC’s ‘Room for Growth’ report 2015, published excellent statistics on Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR in 20 key European cities based on STR Global data and forward projections .The cities included in this report are Dublin, Madrid, London, Rome, Prague, Porto, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Barcelona, Vienna, Lisbon, Frankfurt, Milan, Brussels, Berlin, Belfast, Paris, Geneva, Zurich and Moscow.We picked out the top three cities in terms of RevPAR growth and bring to you a quick account of the stats of that city and what’s driving the growth.Table of Contents1. DublinDublin has the most promising RevPAR growth for all European cities under consideration in the PwC report. In 2014, its RevPAR grew by 11.1% to EUR75. RevPAR is expected to further grow to 81 in 2015 and 88 in 2016. The city is expected to jump from a RevPAR rank of 12 to 10, overtaking Brussels and Frankfurt consecutively.In terms of Occupancy, Dublin occupies the fourth highest rank in Europe at 78.3% in 2014. This is expected to grow to 79.6% in 2015 and 80.2% in 2016. ADR is also growing well – from 95 in 2014 to a projected 102 in 2015 and 109 in 2016. ADR grew by 8.5% in 2014 and was therefore the primary driver for the growth in RevPAR.Dublin’s strong growth is because of a combination of consumer confidence, international tourists, conferences and some major events including The Web Summit and the Croke Park Classic American Football series. The economy has also been doing very well. Ireland was the fastest growing EU economy with a growth rate of 4.3%.However, Dublin’s room supply pipeline is constrained. The city needs to add 5000 bedrooms by 2020 to match growth in visitors, according to the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation. No new supply in expected in 2015.2. MadridWe have all heard about how the tourism in Spain had been affected by the economic crisis. But things have clearly changed and the outlook is now positive.In 2014, Madrid’s RevPAR grew in nearly double digits, attaining 9.7% growth and reaching EUR55. That’s a good turnaround considering that RevPAR had fallen in the past 2 years, by 6.6% to 54 in 2012 and further by 7.2% to 59 in 2013.In absolute RevPAR terms Madrid is placed at No 17 in the PwC report, but in terms of growth, the city occupies the second rank.Madrid is projected to hold the No.2 position in 2015 growing by 5.6% to EUR59 and a further 4.8%  to 61 in 2016. Growth is being driven by ADR as well as Occupancy.In the first half of 2014, there was an increase of two million more tourists in Madrid, compared to H1 2013. This was in part driven by the Government’s new tourism plan, introduced in 2013. Business tourism has been driven by events like the Arcomarid Fair, the Energy Fair and Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.3. LondonLondon is the most visited city in Europe according to Euromonitor International, attracting 16.8 million international visitors in 2013.London’s RevPAR is expected to jump from GBP116 (EUR 144) in 2014 to GBP122 (EUR153) in 2015 and GBP127 (EUR161) in 2016. With this jump, London will occupy the place for 2nd highest RevPAR in Europe. It’s expected to overtake Geneva in 2016, and only behind Paris (in terms of Euros).Despite a projected increase in room supply by more than 11,000 rooms in 2015 and 2016, occupancy is expected to grow to 84% and 85% in the respective years from 83% in 2014. These occupancy levels are the highest in Europe.RevPAR growth, however, is primarily being driven by ADR (from GBP173 in 2014 to 182 in 2015)London’s strong growth projections is expected to be driven by a number of events.One of these is Rugby World Cup. The other one is the European Society of Cardiology’s (ESC) 5 day annual congress in August-September 2015, attended by around 35,000 medical professionals.The UK’s economic outlook is also quite positive – 2.6% GDP growth in 2014 and 2.5% growth in 2015.It’s interesting to note that RevPAR in Paris was EUR203 in 2014 and is projected to be 211 in 2016, far higher than any other European city.A positive outlookEurope’s growth story is looking positive once again. 17 out of 20 cities in the study are projected to have positive growth in 2015. Being major gateway cities, this implies a more positive outlook for most hotels across the region.It’s important for your hotel to prepare for the next phase of this growth story by investing in the right technology will allows you to optimize your pricing and maximize your RevPAR.

656329a7a3f6fc78b8eba342,-575209940,Three important elements your Revenue Management system is missing,"April 29, 2015","You are happy with your revenue management systems.You have a great rate shopping software.You have an equally excellent tool to distribute your inventoryYou are satisfied with your ADR and occupancy.So what’s wrong? Isn’t everything perfect already?Not even close.The question isn’t “Is my RevPAR good enough”Rather it is, “How can I make my RevPAR better?”That’s the question that you need to ask – every single day.Why?\n\nBecause even though your current numbers are great, you are probably still missing 3 important elements:Table of ContentsHere are 3 Elements that can help you make more revenue everyday1. The right dataYour pricing is only as good as the data you consider to arrive at your pricing. Most hotels still look at competitor rates as the only benchmark for determining their prices.\n\nBut do you really think that’s the only thing that matters?Of course, there is room supply and occupancy, but there’s more.What about reviews and ratings? How do they influence the prices that you can charge?Chris Anderson from the Cornell Hospitality Research Center (School of Hotel Administration at Cornell) undertook a research project titled “The Impact of Social Media on Lodging Performance”.The study used data from STR, Travelocity, comScore and TripAdvisor to assess the impact of social media on a hotel’s ability to set prices, drive occupancy and increase revenue.The study concluded that a 1% increase in a hotel’s ReviewPro’s Global Review Index ™ score increases ADR by 0.89%, occupancy by 0.54% and RevPAR by 1.42%.However, we don’t really need studies to tell us that reviews and ratings play an important part in your occupancy as well as ADR.Are you considering the impact of this factor? If yes, how can you use this data quickly to gauge a precise impact on your pricing?2. Automated decisionsData is just the first step to determining your transient prices. How do you quickly use that data to take a decision on what your ideal transient prices should be?Are you dependent on excel sheets to collate large amounts of data and carry out complex calculations?\n\nThe trouble with doing that is there is simply too much data out there to take pricing decisions through manual means. The data also keeps changing all the time. Therefore, to keep up, you would need to continually recalculate new prices.The fact is that it is no longer efficient, or even feasible to continually determine your transient prices manually.You need a system which does it for you. A system which keeps crunching data from various price points and automatically recommends a price at which you will maximize your revenue.More about this in a minute. Let’s come to the third element.3. A Unified SystemOne of the biggest challenges for revenue managers today is speed of response.Today, an increasing number of bookings are being done at the last minute. One of the key causes of this is the increasing rate at which consumers are using mobile devices to carry out bookings.Last minute bookings mean that you will have to keep updating your prices in step as well as distribute your prices.Therefore to have more optimized prices that maximize your RevPAR, you need to respond faster to these changes.You might have excellent price intelligence and distribution tools, but how easy do they make your job in this demanding era of revenue management?Instead of separate systems, what if you had a single system which does carries out all these functions?A single system which gives you intelligence about the various factors that drive transient pricing, recommends an optimum price based on that intelligence and also distributes those prices quickly and accurately.And of course – something which also integrates with your PMS.What you need is UnityRevenue Management is becoming more complex as we speak. What you need is a system which is simple, integrated and accurate. All this in a single suite.\n\nThis suite is our latest innovation at RateGain and we are calling it Unity.Unity is a unified revenue management suite which gathers intelligence from diverse sources, uses that intelligence to arrive at a price and distributes those prices accurately and quickly.The simplest way for you to make more revenues everyday is to get this integrated suite.",https://rategain.com/blog/three-important-elements-your-revenue-management-system-is-missing/,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/11-elements-blog.jpg,https://rategaincom.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/11-elements-blog.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Blog,Hotel Industry,,,,,,,,,0
